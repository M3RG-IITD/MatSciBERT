# MatSciBERT

A Materials Domain Language Model for Text Mining and Information Extraction

## Using MatSciBERT

### Installing requirements
```
bash install_requirements.sh
```

### Importing libraries
```
import torch
from normalize_text import normalize
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
```

### Loading pre-trained model and tokenizer
```
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('m3rg-iitd/matscibert')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('m3rg-iitd/matscibert')
```

### Tokenizing sentences
```
sentences = ['SiO2 is a network former.']
norm_sents = [normalize(s) for s in sentences]
tokenized_sents = tokenizer(norm_sents)
tokenized_sents = {k: torch.Tensor(v).long() for k, v in tokenized_sents.items()}
```

### Obtaining MatSciBERT embeddings
```
with torch.no_grad():
    last_hidden_state = model(**tokenized_sents)[0]
```
