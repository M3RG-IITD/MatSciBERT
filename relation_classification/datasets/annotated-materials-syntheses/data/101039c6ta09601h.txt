Direct evidence for high Na+ mobility and high voltage structural processes in P2-Nax[LiyNizMn1-y-z]O2 (x, y, z <= 1) cathodes from solid-state NMR and DFT calculations
The Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 material was synthesized by co-precipitation. Stoichiometric amounts of the precursors, Mn(NO3)*4H2O and Ni(NO3)*6H2O, were dissolved in deionized water. The transition metal nitrate solutions were titrated into a stoichiometric NaOH solution using a peristaltic pump at 10 ml h-1 rate. The solution was stirred slowly to insure homogeneity. The co-precipitated solid M(OH)2 phase was centrifuged and washed three times with deionized water. The co-precipitated material was dried in the oven to remove excess water and was ground with a stoichiometric amount of Na2CO3. The material was precalcined at 500 degC for 5 h and calcined in pellet form at 900 degC for 14 h in a 50 ml porcelain crucible. The synthesis protocol for the P2-Na0.8Li0.12Ni0.22Mn0.66O2 material was described in our previous study.19
