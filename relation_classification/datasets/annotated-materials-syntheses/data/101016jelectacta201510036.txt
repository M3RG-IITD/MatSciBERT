Li3V2(PO4)3/graphene nanocomposites with superior cycling performance as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries
In a typical synthesis, graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from natural graphite powder via a modified Hummers method [26] and [27].
Pure LVP was synthesized by using a sol-gel method reported in our previous paper [28]. First, oxalic acid (3.02 g) and V2O5 (1.46 g) in a stoichiometric ratio were dissolved in deionized water with magnetic stirring at 70 degC. After a clear blue solution formed, a mixture of stoichiometric NH4H2PO4 (1.84 g) and CH3COOLi*H2O (1.68 g) was added to the solution whilst stirring for 4 h, and then a gel formed in an air oven at 100 degC. The gel was decomposed at 350 degC in an argon atmosphere for 4 h, and the obtained product was ground, pressed into pellets, and sintered at 750 degC for 4 h in flowing argon. The sample was divided into two parts: one was further heated at 750 degC for 2 h in an argon atmosphere; the other was used to prepare LVP/G nanocomposites via a simple precipitation procedure, as described in detail as follows. The as-prepared LVP (1.0 g) was transferred to a suspension of 50 mg graphene oxide dissolved in 500 mL deionized water. The mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature after ultrasonic treatment for 2 h. Subsequently, the mixture was dried by freeze drying. Finally the dried sample was also sintered at 750 degC for 2 h in flowing argon. The procedure for the formation of LVP/G nanocomposites is shown in Scheme 1.
