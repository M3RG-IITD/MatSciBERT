Thermal expansion behavior and high-temperature electrical conductivity of A2-xAx'Cu1-yCoyO4+-δ (A=La, Pr; A'=Pr, Sr) oxides with the K2NiF4-type structure
La2-xPrxCuO4+-δ (x = 0.1; 0.2; 0.4) and La2-xPrxCu1-yCoyO4+-δ (0.1 x 0.5; y = 0.05; 0.1) samples were prepared by conventional solid-state route at 1273 K, 90 h in air with one intermediate regrinding. La2O3, Pr6O11, CuO and Co3O4 were used as initial reagents. Sitrate method was used for the preparation of Pr2-xSrxCu1-xCoxO4+-δ (x = 0.25; 0.5; 0.75). The excess of citric acid monohydrate C6H8O7*H2O was melted in a porcelain cup whereupon stoichiometric amount of SrCO3 (99.999%) was dissolved. Before adding to melt, CuO (99.999%) and Pr2(SO3)3*2.27N2O (99.999%) were dissolved in strong nitric acid, Co(NO3)2*6H2O (99.999%) was dissolved in a minimal amount of water. The mixture was heated in air until the formation of dark solid. The obtained precursors were preliminary annealed at 773 K for 12 h in air. Further pelletized samples were annealed at 1273 K for 48 h in air.
