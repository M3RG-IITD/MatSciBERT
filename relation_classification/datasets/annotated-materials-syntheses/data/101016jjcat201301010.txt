Operando Raman spectroscopy and kinetic study of low-temperature CO oxidation on an α-Mn2O3 nanocatalyst
Mn3O4 nanoparticles wrapped with oleic acid were prepared by a one-pot synthesis method as precursors. First, manganese acetate tetrahydrate (14.7 g) and oleic acid (8.0 ml) were dissolved in methanol (100 ml) under magnetic stirring for 1 h. The solution was then sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (200 ml) and heated to 180 degC for 24 h. Next, the product was dissolved in hexane and Mn3O4 nanoparticles were extracted with ethanol. The brown powder product was washed using deionized water and ethanol and then dried in air for 5 h. The prepared Mn3O4 was calcined in a tubular furnace in an airflow of 50 ml/min at 500 degC with a ramp of 1 degC /min. After 10 h, pure α-Mn2O3 nanoparticles were obtained. It is noted that all chemicals (C.P. grade) are supplied by Shanghai Lingfeng Co. Ltd.
