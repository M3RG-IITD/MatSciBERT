Facile synthesis of a MoO2-Mo2C-C composite and its application as favorable anode material for lithium-ion batteries

All chemical regents employed in this work were of analytical grade without further purification. A pretreated macroporous cinnamic anion-exchange resin (10 g) was first added into 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing 6.18 g ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AHM) and stirred in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature for 10 h. After the adsorption, the resin was filtered, washed several times with distilled water, and dried in air at 60 degC for 24 h. The resulting product was carbonized at 750 degC for 3 h under an argon atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 degC min-1. Finally, the black-colored product was further ground into tiny particles by ball milling and collected for further characterization. For comparison, pure carbon was prepared using the same method to calcine the bare resin without the addition of AHM. Mo2C was bought from Hunan Guangyuan Company and used without any further treatment.
