Synthesis and electrochemical properties of submicron sized sheet-like LiV3O8 crystallites for lithium secondary batteries

Analytical pure LiOH*H2O, NH4VO3 and PVP were used as raw materials without any purification. Stoichiometric amounts of LiOH*H2O and NH4VO3 (Li:V = 1:3, molar ratio) were mixed in deionized water with continuous magnetic stirring. The resultant little yellow solution was then transferred to a 100 mL Teflon lined autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 160 degC and maintained for 1 h under the microwave hydrothermal system (Sineo MDS-8, China). After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally and a colorless clear solution was obtained. This solution was dried in air at 80 degC for 10 h to prepare an orange gel. The gel was ground to powders and then calcined at 400 degC for 10 h in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere. Finally, the powders were cooled to room temperature naturally and ground again to obtain the final products, named as sample A. The synthesis of sample B was the same as sample A, but PVP was added into the solution before microwave hydrothermal.
