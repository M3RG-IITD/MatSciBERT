A Microsized Cagelike Sulfur/Carbon Composite for a Lithium/Sulfur Battery with Excellent Performance
Soluble phenolic resin was prepared by following the methods reported by Zhao et al.22 To synthesize MWCNT@mesoporous carbon, the ratio of the carbon source/template/surfactant was optimized, according to Nazar's group.10 In summary, F127 (1.6 g), ethanol (8.0 g), and 0.2 M HCl (1.0 g) were stirred for 2 h at 40 degC to afford a clear solution. Next, TEOS (2.08 g), MWCNTs (1.0 g), and a 20 wt % solution of resols in ethanol were added in sequence and stirred for another 5 h. The mixture was evaporated at room temperature and held for 24 h at 100 degC in an oven for thermo-polymerization. The as-synthesized product was carbonized in a furnace under an argon atmosphere at 900 degC for 300 min. The obtained sample was then washed with 10 wt % HF to remove silica.
At a weight ratio of 1:1, the MWCNT@MPC composite was mixed with sublimed sulfur under ball-milling for 6 h and then heated at 155 degC for 12 h in an argon atmosphere, resulting in the SC composite. For comparison, pristine S-MPC composite was also prepared by the same method as that described above. For both samples, the sulfur content was 50 wt %.
