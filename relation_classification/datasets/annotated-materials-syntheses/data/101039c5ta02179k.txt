Catalytic reduction of NO x by CO over a Ni-Ga based oxide catalyst
To synthesize the NaGaO2 powder, 0.03 mol of Na2CO3 and 0.03 mol of Ga2O3 were mixed and ground in an agate mortar for 30 min. After that, the mixture of Na2CO3 and Ga2O3 was heated at 850 degC for 12 h and the furnace was then cooled to room temperature. The preparation procedure for Ni1-xZnxGa2O4 (0 < x < 1) was performed as follows: the as-prepared NaGaO2 powder (0.004 mol) was dispersed in 25 mL of deionized water and magnetically stirred for 10 min to obtain a NaGaO2 colloidal solution. The NaGaO2 colloidal solution was added to 20 mL of an aqueous solution of Zn(CH3COO)2*2H2O and Ni(CH3COO)2*4H2O (Ni + Zn 0.004 mol) and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting mixture was heated in a 50 mL Teflon-lined hydrothermal autoclave at 200 degC for 5 h to form the crystalline Ni1-xZnxGa2O4 (0 < x < 1). The sediment was separated by centrifugation and dried at 60 degC for 2 h. Using the same hydrothermal procedure, the ZnGa2O4 and NiGa2O4 powders were prepared.
