Synthesis, characterization of mesoporous silica powders and application to antibiotic remotion from aqueous solution. Effect of supported Fe-oxide on the SiO2 adsorption properties
Cetyltrimethylammonium p-toluene sulfonate or tosylate (CTAT, MW = 455.7 gmol- 1), Pluronic F68 and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99%) were purchased from Aldrich. Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate, potassium hydroxide, potassium chloride, potassium nitrate, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium acetate, acetic acid, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, disodium phosphate anhydrous, and monosodium phosphate anhydrous were obtained from Anedra.
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. Doubly distilled water was used for the preparation of solutions.
Mesoporous silica was prepared using a procedure similar to that described in an earlier work [12]. Briefly, 11.6 mL of TEOS were mixed with 2 mL of water and stirred in an autoclave flask for 10 min at 500 rpm. At the same time, 38 mL of CTAT-Pluronic F68 mixed solution were prepared with a 0.75:0.25 M ratio by adding the desired amount of surfactants to water. This mixture was stirred in a conical flask at 35 degC to form a transparent template solution and then it was left at room temperature. To obtain the mesoporous material, 20 mL of a 1.43 M HCl solution were added drop by drop to the TEOS solution under stirring and 2 min later the surfactant solution was incorporated. The resulting gel, whose composition was 1 TEOS:0.53 HCl:0.011 CTAT:0.0037 F68, was stirred for 5 min and then left for 48 h in an autoclave at 100 degC. After this, the gel was filtered and washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature. Finally, it was calcined in an air flux by increasing the temperature from room temperature to 540 degC with a heating rate of 2degCmin- 1, and holding for 7 h at 540 degC.
Fe-SiO2 was synthesized by a simple batch equilibrium adsorption method. In a beaker, 2 g of calcined SiO2 were mixed with 40 mL of a 0.13 M Fe(NO3)3 solution and stirred for 1 h at 600 rpm. Then, the solid was filtered and washed with water and dried at room temperature. Finally, it was calcined in an air flux for 2 h at 540 degC. The iron content on the silica support was 10.3 mgg- 1 (1.03 wt.%), which was measured by UV-VIS spectroscopy using the thiocyanate colorimetric method [23] after extracting the Fe(III) ions from the solid with concentrated HNO3[24].
