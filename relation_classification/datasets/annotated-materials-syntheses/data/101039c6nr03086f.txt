Valence and oxide impurities in MoS2 and WS2 dramatically change their electrocatalytic activity towards proton reduction
Bulk molybdenum(IV) sulfide powder (<2 Î¼m, 99%), molybdenum(IV) oxide powder (99%), molybdenum(VI) oxide powder (99.97%), tungsten(IV) oxide powder (-100 mesh, 99.99%), and tungsten(VI) oxide powder (99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Singapore while bulk tungsten(IV) sulfide (99.8%) and molybdenum(VI) sulfide dehydrate were obtained from Alfa Aesar (Germany). Ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (99.5%), sodium tungstate dihydrate (99.5%), hydrochloric acid (35%), acetone (99.9%) and carbon disulfide (99.99%) were obtained from Penta, Czech Republic. Selenium (99.5%) and aluminium (99.7%) were obtained from STREM, Germany. H2S (99.5%) and argon (99.999%) were obtained from SIAD, Czech Republic.
Synthesis was performed by acidic decomposition of ammonium tetrathiotungstate. 25 g of sodium tungstate dihydrate was dissolved in 250 mL of water. Subsequently, 100 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid was slowly added to the solution. The tungstic acid that was formed was purified by repeated decantation and centrifugation. Thereafter, the tungstic acid was separated by suction filtration, washed with water and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 degC for 48 hours. Following that, 10 g of tungstic acid was dissolved in 100 mL of concentrated ammonia and filtered using a 450 nm nylon membrane. The solution was then bubbled with H2S gas for 10 hours (about 200 mL min-1). After which, the red crystals of ammonium tetrathiotungstate formed were separated by suction filtration and washed with cold water. To 5 g of (NH4)2WS4 in 5 wt% of ammonia solution, 1 M solution of hydrochloric acid was slowly added to the mixture with vigorous stirring and under an argon atmosphere. WS3 formed was then separated by suction filtration and washed with water followed by acetone. WS3 was subsequently dried under vacuum at 50 degC for 24 hours. Later, WS3 was dispersed in carbon disulfide and repeatedly decanted to remove excess of sulphur. Finally, WS3 was separated by suction filtration, washed with carbon disulfide and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 degC for 48 hours.
