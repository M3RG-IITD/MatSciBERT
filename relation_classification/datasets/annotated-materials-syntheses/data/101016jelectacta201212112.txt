Characterization of glassy carbon electrodes modified with carbon nanotubes and iron phthalocyanine through grafting and click chemistry
Tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4), 4-azidoaniline hydrochloride, iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc), sodium ascorbate, hydrazine sulphate and 4-ethynylpyridine hydrochloride were obtained from Aldrich. Dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile (ACN), and acetone were purchased from Merck. Copper sulphate and potassium chloride were purchased from Saarchem. Single-walled carbon nanotubes functionalised with carboxylic acid groups (SWCNT-COOH, ~1.5 nm in diameter and 1-5 mm in length, >95% purity by thermal gravimetric analysis) were obtained from NanoLab (USA). 4-Azidobenzenediazonium salt was synthesised as reported in literature [52]. All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were used as received.
