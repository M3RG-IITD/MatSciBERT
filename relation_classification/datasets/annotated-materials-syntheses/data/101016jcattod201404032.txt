Synthesis of C2+ hydrocarbons by CO2 hydrogenation over the composite catalyst of Cu-Zn-Al oxide and HB zeolite using two-stage reactor system under low pressure
Among a number of Cu-Zn based methanol synthesis catalysts, we selected a Cu-Zn-Al oxide catalyst with an atomic composition of 6:3:1 in this study, which is analogous to the catalyst actually employed in commercial industrial processes for methanol production [10] and [35]. This Cu-Zn-Al oxide catalyst was prepared by a co-precipitation method using an aqueous solution of the corresponding metal nitrates and Na2CO3. The mixed 1 M solution of Cu, Zn and Al nitrates (6:3:1 in molar ratio) was added at once into the 1 M solution of Na2CO3 at 80 degC. The amount of Na2CO3 was 1.2 equivalents to the total stoichiometric quantities of the nitrates. The precipitate was aged for 2 h at the same temperature, then filtered and washed 5 times with fresh distilled H2O. The gel was dried at 120 degC for 12 h and finally calcined at 500 degC for 4 h or at 350 degC for 3 h in air. The resulting powder, Cu-Zn-Al (6:3:1) oxide, was physically mixed with HB zeolite [Tosoh corporation; HSZ-931HOA (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28.5) or HSZ-940HOA (SiO2/Al2O3 = 41.6)] by grinding about 1000 times in various weight ratios to give the composite catalysts. The Cu-Zn (3:7) oxide catalyst and its composite catalyst were prepared by the procedures similar to those described above.
