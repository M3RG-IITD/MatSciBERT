Low Electron Scattering Potentials in High Performance Mg 2 Si 0.45 Sn 0.55 Based Thermoelectric Solid Solutions with Band Convergence

Mg2(1+x)Si0.45Sn0.537Sb0.013 (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12) compounds were synthesized by a B2O3 flux method.22 Elemental Mg (99%), Si (99.9%), Sn (99.5%) and Sb (99.999%) powders were utilized. All preparation steps were performed in an argon glove box. Raw powders were weighed, and thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar. The starting materials were transferred into an alumina crucible, covered by B2O3 powders and then compacted. The crucibles were placed into a chamber furnace, heated at 973 K for 10 h and finally cooled down to room temperature. The ingots were ground and sieved to ~50 μm and hot pressed in a graphite die of Φ 12.7 mm under a pressure of 80 MPa at 1025 K for 2 h, resulting in compact pellets for property analysis. Sample pellets 12.7 mm in diameter were used to measure the thermal conductivity and Hall carrier concentration, and then cut into rectangular bars for the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements.
