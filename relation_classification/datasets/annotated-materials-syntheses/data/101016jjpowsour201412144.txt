Performance and durability of carbon black-supported Pd catalyst covered with silica layers in membrane-electrode assemblies of proton exchange membrane fuel cells
Pd/CB was supplied from Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo Co., Ltd. The specific surface area of the CB supports was ca. 550 m2 g-1, and the content and the average diameter of Pd particles was 29 wt.% and ca. 5 nm, respectively. Pd/CB was covered with silica layers by the successive hydrolysis of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) [16] and [17]. 550 mg of Pd/CB was ultrasonically dispersed in 220 mL of pure water at 60 degC, and the pH of this solution was adjusted to 10.5 by the addition of triethylamine. The hydrolysis of APTES was performed at 60 degC over 30 min by the addition of 290 mg of APTES (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) to the solutions. Subsequently, 1150 mg of TEOS (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) was added to the solutions to cover the samples with thick silica layers. After the solutions were stirred for 3 h at 60 degC, they were filtered and washed several times with pure water. The samples thus obtained were heat-treated at 350 degC under H2/N2 (H2: 5 vol.%) atmosphere for 2 h. Silica-coated Pd/CB is denoted SiO2/Pd/CB hereafter. The morphology of the silica layers were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, HD-2700, Hitachi High-Technologies Corp.) For comparison, Pt/CB (Pt loading: 46 wt.%, TEC10E50E) was also supplied from Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo Co., Ltd.
