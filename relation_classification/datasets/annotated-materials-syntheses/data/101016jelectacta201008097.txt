Degradation of the beta-blocker propranolol by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes based on Fenton's reaction chemistry using a boron-doped diamond anode
Propranolol hydrochloride of 99% purity was supplied by the pharmaceutical AstraZeneca Espana (Madrid, Spain). 1-Naphthol was reactive reagent from BDH Chemical Ltd. and phthalic acid was analytical reagent from Aldrich. Oxamic and oxalic acids were analytical grade from Panreac. Sulfuric acid, anhydrous sodium sulfate and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate were analytical grade from Merck and Fluka. Solutions were prepared with pure water obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q system with TOC content < 1 μg dm-3 and resistivity > 18 MΩ cm at 25 degC. Organic solvents and other chemicals used were either HPLC or analytical grade from Merck, Fluka, Panreac and Aldrich.
