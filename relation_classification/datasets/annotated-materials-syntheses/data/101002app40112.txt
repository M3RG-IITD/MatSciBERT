Comparison of the effects of phenyl dichlorophosphate modified and unmodified β-iron(III) oxide hydroxide on the thermal, combustion, and mechanical properties of ethylene-vinyl acetate/magnesium hydroxide composites
Phenyl dichlorophosphate (PDCP), iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3*6H2O), and tetrahydrofuran were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. These reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. MH was kindly provided by KeYan Co. (Hefei, China). The EVA copolymer, containing 28 wt % VA, was supplied by Hanwha CO., Ltd. (Korea).
β-Fe(O)OH was prepared by a typical experiment,[10, 11] FeCl3 (0.487 g) was dissolved in distilled water (30 mL) under stirring. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 40-mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Hydrothermal synthesis was carried out in an oven at 110degC for 2 h. The products were collected by filtration, washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, and then dried in an oven at 60degC for 6 h.
Surface modification of β-Fe(O)OH was prepared by the mixture of 10 mL of PDCP with 1 g of β-Fe(O)OH. After it was shaken for a short time, the mixture was moved into a three-necked, round-bottom flask. Then, water (20 mL) was slowly added in to the three-necked, round-bottom flask at 10degC for 5 h. Thereafter, the product was filtered and washed with low-density polyethylene on a Soxhlet extractor for over 36 h. Finally, the particles were dried at 60degC in an oven for 24 h. The obtained particles were labeled β-Fe(O)OPDCP.
