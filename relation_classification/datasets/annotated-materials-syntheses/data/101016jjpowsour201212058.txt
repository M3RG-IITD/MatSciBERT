Tailoring of phase composition and morphology of TiO2-based electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries

The mixed titania phases were synthesized via hydrothermal treatment in alkaline environment based on procedure by Yoshida et al. [14]. As starting material TiO2 from Umicore was used which was mixed with NaOH in distilled water. Throughout stirring a homogeneous solution was obtained which was transferred into a Teflon lined autoclave and kept at 150 degC for 72 h. After cooling naturally to ambient temperature the white, sorbet-like product was washed in distilled water to eliminate remaining NaOH before washing in 0.1 M HCl at pH <= 2. In a final washing step the solution was brought to neutrality. Subsequently the product was dried at [?]100 degC, ground and sieved to a 50 Î¼m mesh. In a final preparation step the white powder samples were heat treated in air at 450 degC for 4 h in air. The experimental procedure is shown in a simplified flow chart, see Fig. 1.
