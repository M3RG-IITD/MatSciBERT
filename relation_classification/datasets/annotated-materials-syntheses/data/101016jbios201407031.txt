Leaf-templated synthesis of 3D hierarchical porous cobalt oxide nanostructure as direct electrochemical biosensing interface with enhanced electrocatalysis
Cobalt acetate (Co(COOH)2*4H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and d-glucose were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corporation (Shanghai, China). Nafion(r) perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt% in mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents are of analytical grade and were used without purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (18.2 MÎ© cm). The mature gingko leaves were collected from the local park. H2O2 and glucose solutions with different concentrations were diluted from their respective stock solution with 0.1 M NaOH solution.
The mature gingko leaves were treated with 2 M hydrochloric acid solution for 3 h. After rinsing thoroughly with water and subsequent drying at 60 degC for 3 h, the leaves were subsequently immersed in 0.1 M Co(CH3COO)2 solution at room temperature overnight. After drying at 60 degC, the leaves were calcined in air at 400 degC for 3 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The remaining powder was washed several times with water and collected by centrifugation. After drying at 60 degC overnight, the black Co3O4 was obtained. The powder was finely ground in an agate mortar and stored at room temperature. For the control experiment, non-templated Co3O4 was prepared from Co(CH3COO)2 solution by the same method except that the leaf template had not been used.
