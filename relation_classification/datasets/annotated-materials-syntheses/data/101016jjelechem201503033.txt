Electrochemical lithium storage kinetics of self-organized nanochannel niobium oxide electrodes

Oriented nanochannel Nb2O5 films were prepared by electrochemical anodization of Nb foils (99.8% purity, Alfa Aesar). The anodization process was performed in a 10 wt.% K2HPO4 containing glycerol solution with a Pt counter electrode. The Nb foils were biased at 10 and 20 V for 5-25 min at 180 degC to produce nanoporous films with thicknesses ranging from 7 to 18 μm. After electrochemical anodization, the as-prepared films were cleaned with distilled water several times. The Nb2O5 films on Nb substrates were heated to 440 degC in air at a heating rate of 1 degC min-1. After annealing at 440 degC for 20 min, the furnace was cooled to room temperature automatically. The crystal structure of the obtained samples was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO Multi-Purpose X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, operating at 60 kV and 55 mA). The film thickness and morphology of the prepared samples were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL 7500) and field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV).
