High-density iron nanoparticles encapsulated within nitrogen-doped carbon nanoshell as efficient oxygen electrocatalyst for zinc-air battery

Dicyandiamide and ammonium ferric citrate are used as pyrolysis precursors.

In a typical experiment, 8 g of dicyandiamide (C2H4N4, Alfa Aesar, denoted as DCDA) and 1 g of ammonium ferric citrate (C6H11FeNO7, J&K Chemical Ltd., denoted as AFC) were dissolved in 100 mL of de-ionized water. The solution was continuously stirred and dried at 80 degC. The obtained mixture was placed in a quartz tube of a horizontal furnace. The pyrolysis of the mixture was performed in Ar atmosphere at a flow rate of 50 mL min-1. The furnace was heated to the target temperature at a rate of 10 degC min-1 and kept at the target temperature for 2 h, then cooled to room temperature. The target temperature was set as 600, 700, 800 and 900 degC, respectively. Then the samples were leached in 0.5 M HClO4 solution at 80 degC for 8 h to remove unstable iron species, and washed thoroughly with de-ionized water. Finally, the samples were dried at 60 degC in an oven. The samples are labeled as Fe@N-C-X, in which X represents pyrolysis temperature. For highlighting the role of iron precursor, ferric chloride was used instead of AFC, and the mixture of DCDA and ferric chloride was pyrolyzed at 700 degC, followed by acid-leaching and washing, which is denoted as D-FC-700. The weight ratio of DCDA to iron was kept identical in the DCDA-AFC and DCDA-FeCl3 mixtures.
