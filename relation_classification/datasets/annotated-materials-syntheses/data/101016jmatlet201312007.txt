Hydrothermal synthesis and electrochemical properties of hexagonal hydrohausmannite plates as supercapacitor electrode material
A 200 mg KMnO4, 100 mg NaOH and 100 mg glucose were dissolved in deionized water with total volume 30 mL. After stirring, the solution was transferred into an autoclave and heated at 200 degC for 72 h, then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The product was repeatedly washed with deionized water and ethanol, then dried at 60 degC for 10 h. The product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, a Philips X' Pert Pro. Diffractometer), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6701F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai-G2-F30 and Hitachi H-600). Electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E) in a three electrode system in 1 M Na2SO4 solution, with Pt foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the counter electrode and reference electrode. After mixing the product: acetylene black: polytetrafluorene-ethylene (PTFE) at a mass ratio of 80:15:5, the mixture was pressed onto nickel foam and dried at 60 degC overnight as the working electrode. The mass loading is about 7.6 mg (9.5 mg/cm2).
