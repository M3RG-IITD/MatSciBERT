Exploring the working mechanism of Li + in O3-type NaLi 0.1 Ni 0.35 Mn 0.55 O 2 cathode materials for rechargeable Na-ion batteries
Both O3-type NLNMO and NNMO were synthesized by a co-precipitation method. NiSO4*6H2O and MnSO4*H2O were titrated into a stoichiometric NaOH solution to form a precursor TM(OH)2. The precursor was washed and dried at 120 degC for 12 h, and then stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 (only in NLNMO), Na2CO3, and TM(OH)2 were mixed with acetone as a dispersant via ball milling for 6 h and dried at 120 degC. The mixture was pressed into pellets, calcined at 900 degC for 12 h in air and then cooled down to room temperature in the furnace. The samples were then stored in an Ar-filled glove box until characterization or cell construction for protection from moisture and air, since otherwise Na+ would have been extracted from the material.24
