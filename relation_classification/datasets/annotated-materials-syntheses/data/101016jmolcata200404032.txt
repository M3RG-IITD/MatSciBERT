Characterization of copper oxide supported on ceria-modified anatase
TiO2 support was prepared via hydrolysis of titanium alkoxides, the product was washed, dried and then calcined in flowing air at 500 degC for 5 h. The anatase crystalline form of the product was identified by XRD [27], and the BET surface area is 83 m2 g-1.
CeO2/TiO2 (ceria-modified TiO2) was prepared by impregnating TiO2 with an aqueous solution of cerious nitrate followed by drying at 100 degC overnight and then calcined in flowing air at 500 degC for 7 h.
CuO/CeO2/TiO2 samples were prepared by impregnating CeO2/TiO2 with an aqueous solution of cupric nitrate followed by drying at 100 degC overnight and then calcined in flowing air at 500 degC for 7 h. For the sake of simplicity, CuO/CeO2/TiO2 samples were noted as xCu-yCe-Ti, e.g. 4Cu-3Ce-Ti corresponds to the sample with copper oxide and ceria loading amount of 4 and 3 wt.% respectively. The results of BET surface area of ceria-modified TiO2 suggest that the change of support surface area could be neglected in this system, which is consistent to the results reported in the literature [7].
