Ultrathin Surface Modification by Atomic Layer Deposition on High Voltage Cathode LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 for Lithium Ion Batteries


LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles were synthesized through solid-state reactions. Nickel acetate [Ni(Ac)2[?]4 H2O] and manganese acetate [Mn(Ac)2[?]4 H2O] were mixed at a molar ratio of Ni/Mn=1:3 and milled in a mortar. After heating at 500 degC for 5 h, lithium acetate (LiAc[?]2 H2O) was added to the mixture at a molar ratio of Li/Ni/Mn=2.1:1:3 (5 % excess Li source was added to balance for the volatilized Li during calcination), and the mixture was heated to 500 degC for 5 h once more. Then the mixture was milled and sintered at 950 degC for 10 h followed by annealing at 700 degC for 10 h.
