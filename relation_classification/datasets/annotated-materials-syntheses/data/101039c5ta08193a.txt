High efficiency hysteresis-less inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with a solution-derived NiOx hole contact layer
3.084 g nickel(II) acetylacetonate and 1.262 g diethanolamine were added into 30 ml ethanol and the mixture was continuously stirred at 60 degC for 12 h to make a clear green solution. Then, the green solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 50 ml capacity and kept in an oven which was previously set to 150 degC for 10 h. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature after the reaction and the resulting dark green solution was filtered and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min successively. Following this, the upper clear green solution was collected and mixed with about 400 ml cyclohexane, which was then stirred for tens of minutes until a turbid solution was obtained. Finally, the turbid solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 6 min and the precipitation was collected and dispersed again in some ethanol to make NiOx nanoparticles solutions with different concentrations.
