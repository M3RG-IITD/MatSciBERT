Controlled Synthesis and High Oxidation Stability of Cobalt Nanoparticles Encapsulated in Mesoporous Silica using a Modified Stober Approach and a Pseudomorphic Transformation
Materials: Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (VWR Prolabo, 98 %), sodium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 %), citric acid monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5 %), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, VWR Prolabo, 99.9 %), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, C19H42BrN, Sigma, >=98 %), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) PVP (Sigma-Aldrich, average mol. wt 40000), NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, >=98 %), and EtOH (VWR, absolute 99.9 %) were used as received. Deionized water (18 MΩ cm) was used for all the preparations after deoxygenation.
Synthesis of the Co NPs: Citrate-stabilized Co NPs were prepared from classical NaBH4 reduction.56 In a typical synthesis, cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (115.5 mg, 0.397 mmol) and citric acid monohydrate (83-167 mg, 0.397-0.793 mmol, 1-2 equiv.) were added to deoxygenated water (175 mL) under mechanical stirring. After 1 h under nitrogen stripping, NaBH4 (150 mg, 3.97 mmol, 10 equiv.) previously solubilized in cold water (5 mL) was quickly added to the vigorously stirred solution. The mixture turned black, which is indicative of reduced cobalt NP formation. In certain cases, PVP (600 mg) was added immediately after the introduction of NaBH4 to form PVP-stabilized Co NPs. Complete dissolution of the polymer occurred rapidly (<1 min).
Encapsulation of the Co NPs in Silica, Co@SiO2: Co@SiO2 were prepared by controlled growth of the silica shell on the Co NPs in an ethanol/water mixture according to a modified Stober method.16 After the in situ synthesis of the Co NPs, an ethanol solution (390-780 mL) containing APTES (77 μL, 0.331 mmol, 0.8 equiv.) and TEOS (881 μL, 3.97 mmol, 10 equiv.) was added to the NP solution. This one-pot reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 h before centrifuging and drying to isolate the silica-coated particles.
Synthesis of Cobalt-Mesoporous Silica NPs (Co@m-SiO2): Co@SiO2 were used as a silica source for the synthesis of Co@m-SiO2 by a PMT.40 The appropriate quantity of Co@SiO2 was dispersed into an alkaline solution containing CTAB. The molar composition of the system was 1:0.11:0.24:395:36 SiO2/CTAB/NaOH/H2O/EtOH. After 1 h of stirring at room temperature, the gel was put in an autoclave and heated at 100 degC for 24 h under static conditions. The final solid was recovered by centrifugation, washed with water, and dried at 80 degC for 12 h. The CTAB rod-like template was removed by thermal treatment under hydrogen in a programmed heated tubular oven before use. The temperature was initially increased from room temperature to 400 degC at a rate of 5 degC min-1, and the temperature kept for 4 h to remove the organic phase.
Synthesis of Co/SiO2: The cobalt-based reference catalyst Co/SiO2 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation over a silica-based carrier (SBET = 241 m2 g-1, Vp = 0.41 mL g-1, and Dp = 5.7 nm) starting from an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate. Subsequently, the impregnated catalyst was dried by direct heating of the sample from room temperature to 85 degC for one night. Finally, the catalyst was calcined at 420 degC in dry air for 4 h and activated by a reduction treatment under pure hydrogen. To achieve a Co loading of 12.7 wt.-%, two successive incipient wetness impregnations were realized (see the Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figures S1 and S2, for characterization).
