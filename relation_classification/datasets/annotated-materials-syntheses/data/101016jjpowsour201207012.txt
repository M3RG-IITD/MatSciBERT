Direct synthesis of palladium nanoparticles on Mn3O4 modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes: A highly active catalyst for methanol electro-oxidation in alkaline media
All chemical reagents used in this experiment were of analytical grade. Sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, ethanol, methanol, NaOH, H2PdCl4, KMnO4, NaBH4 and polyethlyleneglycol 20,000 (PEG 20000) were procured commercially and used without further purification. The raw MWCNTs were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotechnologies Port Co. Ltd. (Shenzhen, China) with the diameter of 40-60 nm, length of 5-15 Î¼m, and purity of 98%. Nafion (perfluorosulfonic acid-PTFE copolymer) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (A Johnson Matthey Company) with the concentration of 5% w/w solution.

Raw-MWCNTs were refluxed in a concentrated H2SO4-HNO3 mixture (8.0 M for each acid) at a bath temperature of 80 degC with duration of 2 h to remove the impurities. The acid-treated MWCNTs (AO-MWCNTs) were washed for several times with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 70 degC for 12 h for further use.

For preparing the Mn3O4/MWCNT composites, the AO-MWCNTs, hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were used as the starting material, PEG 20000 as the surfactant and reducing agent. A typical synthesis route was as follows: 5 mL of 0.1 M KMnO4 and 2.5 mL of 50 g L-1 PEG 20000 was mixed in 100 mL beaker, stirred for 30 min. 30 mg AO-MWCNTs and 10 mL of H2O was dispersed in 50 mL beaker after 30 min sonication and this suspension was added into the above solution with continuous stirring for 2 h. Then 1.0 M hydrochloric acid was added to the solution until its pH dropped to about 2.0, and then stirred about 2 h at room temperature until the color of the KMnO4 faded. Finally, the resulting product was centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol respectively, dried overnight at 70 degC to obtain high purified Mn3O4/MWCNTs.

Pd-Mn3O4/MWCNTs (20 wt.% metal content) nano-sized catalysts were synthesized using NaBH4 as reducing agent by wet impregnation method: 20 mg of Mn3O4/MWCNTs powder was dispersed in 20 mL ethanol/water (1:1, v/v ratio) solution in 100 mL beaker, mixed with 9.4 mL of 5 mM H2PdCl4 solution and stirred for 10 h. A freshly prepared solution of 50 mg NaBH4 in 10 mL water was added dropwise into the above solution under vigorous stirring. After stirred for an additional 2 h, the black solid was centrifuged and washed with deionized water for several times, and then dried overnight in oven at 70 degC. For comparison, Pd nanoparticles supported on MWCNTs and Vulcan XC-72 catalysts were also obtained by the same process. The Mn3O4 content of prepared Pd-Mn3O4/MWCNTs was 40 wt. % and the palladium loading of every catalysts was 20 wt. %.
