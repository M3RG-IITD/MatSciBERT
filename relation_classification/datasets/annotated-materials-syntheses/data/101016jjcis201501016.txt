Carbon microspheres via microwave-assisted synthesis as counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells
CSs were prepared using the method reported in our previous works [36]. In briefly, 6.846 g sucrose and 2 g concentrated sulfuric acid were dissolved in 100 ml mixing solvent of water and ethylene glycol (6:4 v/v). Subsequently, 20 ml of the solution was heated at 160 degC with a microwave irradiation power of 100 W for 10 min using a microwave system (Explorer-48, CEM Co.). After being centrifuged and washed with deionized water, the resultant precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 degC for 24 h and finally thermally treated at different temperatures for 2 h in nitrogen. In this work, CSs with different thermal temperatures of 600, 800 and 1000 degC are named as CS600, CS800 and CS1000, respectively. The as-synthesized CSs were deposited on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) (resistivity: 14 Î©/#, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) glass by screen printing. The as-prepared counter electrodes were sintered at 400 degC for 30 min. The conventional Pt film was also used as counter electrodes for comparison.
