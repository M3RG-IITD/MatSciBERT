Synthesis of zeolite NaX at 25degC and 95degC: Characterization, cobalt exchange and catalytic performance in epoxidation of styrene
The synthesis of zeolite NaX was performed by the following: sodium silicate (Na2SiO3[?]9H2O > 98%) was completely dissolved in deionized water to get solution A; sodium hydroxide (99%) was dissolved in deionized water, followed by addition of sodium aluminate (anhydrous) to get solution B. Solution A was poured into solution B under vigorous stirring, the molar composition of the resultant hydrogel was 4.0Na2O:0.2 Al2O3:1.0SiO2:200H2O. The hydrogel was stirred for 30 min and then transferred to the polypropylene bottles, sealed and placed in water bath (T = 25 degC) and oil bath (T = 95 degC). After a given period of synthesis, the solid products were filtered off, washed with deionized water until the pH reached around 8, then dried in air at 100 degC for 24 h.

Co2+ ions were introduced into zeolite NaX by a simple ion exchange method. In a typical run, 5.0 g of zeolite was treated with 0.3 M aqueous solution of the cobalt nitrate (150 ml) at 300 K for 24 h. The solid powder was recovered by filtration, washed several times with deionized water until no acidic residue was detected, and followed by drying at 40 degC in vacuum for 48 h. Zeolite NaX samples with varying amounts of cobalt exchange were prepared by repeated ion exchanges of the zeolite.

The epoxidation of styrene with O2 was performed in a 50 ml three-necked flat-bottomed glass flask equipped with a liquid condenser under atmospheric pressure. Typically, 10 mmol of styrene (>99%), a measured amount of solvent N,N'-dimethylformamide (99.5%, DMF) and a certain amount of catalyst were added to the reactor. The reaction mixture was magnetically stirred at 600 rpm and heated to the desired temperature. The reaction was started by bubbling O2 into the liquid.
