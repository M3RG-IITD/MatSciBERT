Catalytic Performance of Zeolite-Supported Vanadia in the Aerobic Oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-diformylfuran
5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF; >99 %), acetonitrile (>=99.9 %), toluene (anhydrous, 99.8 %), α,α,α-trifluorotoluene (TFT) (>=99 %), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; >=99.9 %), ammonium metavanadate (>=99 %), oxalic acid (>=99 %), sodium nitrate (>=99 %), and anisole (99 %) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK; >=98 %) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; >=99 %) were purchased from Fluka. 2,5-Diformylfuran (DFF; 98 %) was supplied by ABCR GmbH & Co. Dioxygen (99.5 %) was purchased from Air Liquide, Denmark. All NH4-zeolites were obtained from Zeolyst International, USA. Vanadium oxide (99.8 %) was acquired from Chr. Gerner-Jensen. All chemicals were used as received.

Commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (Si/Al=15), NH4-beta (Si/Al=25), NH4-mordenite (Si/Al=10) and NH4-Y (Si/Al=12) zeolites were initially calcined at 550 degC for 5 h to obtain the H-ZSM-5, H-beta, H-mordenite, and H-Y supports, respectively.

Vanadia supported on zeolite catalysts with 1-10 wt % V2O5 were prepared by wet impregnation of the supports with vanadium oxalate solution, by a procedure adopted from the literature.44 In a typical experiment to prepare 3 wt % zeolite-supported vanadia catalyst, 1.75 mL of NH4VO3/oxalic acid aqueous solution (0.378 M, prepared from ammonium metavanadate and oxalic acid in the molar ratio 1:2 at 70 degC) was added to 1 g of the zeolite using an incipient wetness impregnation technique. Once the impregnation was completed, the solids were dried at 120 degC for 8 h and then calcined at 500 degC for 5 h. The catalysts were named according to the nominal V2O5 loading in wt % and the support.

For the preparation of the Na-beta support, 10 g of NH4-beta were suspended in 300 mL of 1 M aqueous solution of NaNO3. The mixture was heated to 80 degC and stirred for 1 hour. Afterwards, the zeolite was filtered and washed with distilled water. This procedure was repeated twice. Finally, the recovered Na-beta material was dried and then calcined at 500 degC for 5 h.
