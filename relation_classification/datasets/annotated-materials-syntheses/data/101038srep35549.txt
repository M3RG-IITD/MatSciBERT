A simple, one-step hydrothermal approach to durable and robust superparamagnetic, superhydrophobic and electromagnetic wave-absorbing wood
All chemicals were supplied by Shanghai Boyle Chemical Co. Ltd (Shanghai. China). and used without further purification. The wood slices were cut to dimensions of 10 mm (length) x 10 mm (width) x 10 mm (height), and then the slices were ultrasonically rinsed with deionized water for 30 minutes and dried at 80 degC in a vacuum.
In a typical synthesis, FeCl3[?]6H2O (3.24 g) and MnCl2[?]4H2O (0.94 g) in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 were dissolved in 80 mL of a deionized water solution with the wood samples under magnetic stirring for 2 h at room temperature. During the stirring process, FAS-17 (1 mL) and the proper amount of ammonia (3 mL) were added dropwise into the solution. Then, the obtained homogeneous mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, and this vessel was sealed and heated to 120 degC for 8 hours. Subsequently, the autoclave was left to cool to room temperature. Finally, the prepared magnetic wood samples were removed from the solution, ultrasonically rinsed with deionized water for 30 minutes, and dried at 45 degC for over 24 hours in vacuum.
