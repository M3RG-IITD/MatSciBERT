Microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of electrochemically active nano-sized Li2MnO3 dispersed on carbon nanotube network for lithium ion batteries
Electrochemically active Li2MnO3/CNT nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by MAH process. The detailed synthesis procedure of MnO2-coated CNT composite through redox reaction is described elsewhere [15]. A 0.1 M of KMnO4 solution and 1.0 g of CNT in double jacket vessel were heated to 70 degC using circulator (FP40, Julabo), and the mixture was maintained at same temperature for 12 h. The black suspension was filtered, washed, and then dried at 100 degC in oven. The LMO/CNT nanocomposite was prepared using MnO2-coated CNT composite with appropriate amount of different concentration of aqueous LiOH solution (0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.5 M, and 1 M). These solution mixtures were rapidly heated to 200 degC in MAH reactor (MARS, CEM Corp.), maintained at 200 degC for (30 min), and cooled down to room temperature. The suspension was filtered, washed repeatedly with distilled water, and dried at 100 degC for 24 h in oven. The four different samples of LMO/CNT nanocomposites are named as shown in Table 1.
