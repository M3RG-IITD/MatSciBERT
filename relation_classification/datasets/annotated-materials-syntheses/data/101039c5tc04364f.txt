A robust, gravure-printed, silver nanowire/metal oxide hybrid electrode for high-throughput patterned transparent conductors
Ag NWs dispersed in ethanol were purchased from Blue Nano Inc. (average diameter D = 33 nm, average length = 14 μm). Glass substrates (1 mm thick) were obtained from VWR Scientific. Planarized polyethylene naphthalate substrates (PEN) were provided by Dupont Teijin Films. All solvents and sol-gel precursors were obtained from Sigma Aldrich.
IZO/Ag NW composite inks were prepared from a mixture of Ag NWs dispersed in ethanol and IZO sol-gel precursors (Indium Acetate, 99.99%, Zinc Acetate dehydrate, 99.99%) dissolved in a 2:1 mixture (volume ratio) of 2-methoxyethanol and monoethanolamine. The sol-gel precursor ink was sonicated for 1 hour until complete dissolution occurred, and the solution was subsequently filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter before mixing with the Ag NW dispersion. During storage in a dry environment, the ink remained stably dispersed for more than one month.
