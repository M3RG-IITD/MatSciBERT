Template-Directed Synthesis of Pillared-Porous Carbon Nanosheet Architectures: High-Performance Electrode Materials for Supercapacitors
Porous MgO Layer Template: 100 mg MgO nanoparticles (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.) were added into 500 mL aqueous solution under the ultrasonication (KQ-600KDE, 600 W) for 30 min, and subsequently boiled for 2-24 h to form Mg(OH)2 using a reflux apparatus. After the filtration and desiccation at 100 degC for 24 h, the as-obtained material was calcined at 500 degC for 30 min.
Synthesis Process: Briefly, 1 g of coal tar pitch (Taiyuan Steel Co. Ltd., China, softening point: 160 degC) was dissolved in 40 mL tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution under stirring. Subsequently, 2 g of porous MgO was added with stirring until complete homogenization. After that, the mixed solution was aged at 60 degC for 48 h, followed by heating at 900 degC for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 degC min-1 in an N2 flow. After carbonization, the black carbon/MgO composite was washed using 10 wt% HCl to remove the MgO, followed by filtration and drying of the sample. For comparasion, nanofoam, and porous layered carbon materials were prepared by the same process as mentioned above using MgO nanoparticle and Mg(OH)2 nanosheet as the template, respectively.
