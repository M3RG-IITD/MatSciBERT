Effect of chemical treatment on the thermoelectric properties of single walled carbon nanotube networks
The SWCNTs used in this study were synthesized by the CVD method and purchased from Thomas Swan & Co. LTD, Crockhall, Consett, UK (Product Ref: PR0920), in the form of a "wet cake." To prepare SWCNT buckypapers, the SWCNT suspension in 0.5% sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) was vacuum filtrated using a polycarbonate membrane (pore size 0.2 um, from Millipore). SDBS was removed by rinsing several times with de-ionized water. After drying on a filter in air, the free standing SWCNT films were peeled off from the membrane. The thickness of the obtained buckypapers was approximately 35 um.
