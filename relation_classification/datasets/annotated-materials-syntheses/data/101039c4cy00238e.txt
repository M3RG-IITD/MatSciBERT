Synthesis, acid properties and catalysis by niobium oxide nanostructured materials
Dichloromethane and acetonitrile were purified with a LC Technology Solutions Inc. SPBT-1 Bench-Top Solvent Purification System. Compound 1 was synthesized according to literature procedures.9 NbCl5 and Nb(OEt)5 used in the preparation of T-I and T-II were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Commercial Nb2O5 (Puratronic(r), 99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Pluronic (P123) and dodecylamine 98% were used as structure-directing agents and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water (resistivity 18.2 MΩ cm-1 at 25 degC; 0.22 μm filter) was used in all preparations and reactions requiring aqueous conditions.
Synthesis of the Nb2O5 materials discussed within this contribution have been adapted from previously reported procedures. The methods used are briefly described in the following paragraphs:
5 g of NbCl5 (18.5 mmol) were dissolved in 99% ethanol (10 mL) under constant stirring. To this solution NH4OH (1 M) was slowly added to the aforementioned solution until a white precipitate was observed. The precipitate was then separated from the solution by centrifugation (3000 rpm), washed four times using Milli-Q water and dried at 120 degC for 24 hours.
5 g of NbCl5 (18.5 mmol) were dissolved in 200 mL Milli-Q water. Immediately after addition, the yellow powder became white. After stirring for 3 h at room temperature, the white precipitate was centrifuged (3000 rpm) and washed four times with Milli-Q water until the filtrate was at neutral pH. The obtained solid was dried at 120 degC for 24 hours.
1.5 g of P-123 were dispersed in 11 mL of Milli-Q water and 45 mL of HCl (2 M) at 40 degC. 5 g of Nb(OEt)5 (15.7 mmol) was added to solution under stirring. The resulting mixture was kept at 40 degC for 24 hours and then precipitated in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 100 degC for 48 hours. The obtained solid was filtered, washed with Milli-Q water and dried in air at room temperature. Excess surfactant was removed by Soxhlet extraction first by washing with 1% HCl in 95% EtOH (300 mL) and then with 95% EtOH only (120 mL). The final, template-free mesoporous Nb2O5*nH2O was dried in the oven at 120 degC for 18 hours.
A mixture of Nb(OEt)5 (3.25 g, 10.3 mmol) and dodecylamine (0.57 g, 3.1 mmol) was heated until a homogeneous solution was obtained. Subsequent addition of 65.4 mL of Milli-Q water with manual stirring resulted in the formation of a gel-like precipitate. Further addition of 27.6 μL (0.3 mmol) concentrated HCl afforded a white precipitate. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand overnight, sealed and heated at 40 degC for 30 hours, 60-65 degC for 66 hours, 80 degC for 48 hours, and 95-100 degC for 5 days. The solid was then cooled down, collected by filtration and dried at 95-100 degC for 2 hours, 120 degC for 48 hours, and 140 degC for 48 hours. The white solid was then washed four times to remove the presence of excess surfactant. Each washing cycle was conducted for 24 hours under vigorous stirring followed by Buchner filtration. 645 mg (3.4 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid in 13 mL of ether were added to 100 mL of MeOH for the first wash. For the second wash, 65 mg (0.3 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid in 3 mL of ether were added to 100 mL of MeOH. Third and fourth washings were done using MeOH (100 mL) only. The final, template-free mesoporous Nb2O5*nH2O was dried into the oven at 120 degC for 24 hours.
