Keggin type heteropoly acid, encapsulated in metal-organic framework: A heterogeneous and recyclable nanocatalyst for selective oxidation of sulfides and deep desulfurization of model fuels
For the synthesis of PMo@HKUST-1(I), PW@HKUST-1(II) and SiW@HKUST-1(III) catalysts, the mixture of BTC (0.21 g, 1 mmol) and 0.10 g of CTAB in absolute ethanol (14 mL) was prepared and then 0.06 g of PMo for (I), 0.1 g of PW for (II), 0.1 g of SiW for (III), and 1.45 g of copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2*3H2O) were dissolved in distilled water (10 mL), Both solutions were combined and mixed under vigorous stirring for approximately 30 min and were aged without stirring for a further 2 days in the case of (I) and 4 days for (II and III) at room temperature. A green (I), blue (II) and light blue (III) precipitate were then collected, washed with distilled water three times and dried at 60 degC for 24 h. CTAB was removed by Soxhlet extraction with ethanol (laboratory use, Chem-Lab) which was performed for 24 h. The product was dried in air at 60 degC. The yields were 95%, 92.6% and 86.4% for (I), (II) and (III) respectively.
