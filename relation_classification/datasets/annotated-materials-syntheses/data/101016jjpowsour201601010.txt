Carbon-coated silicon nanotube arrays on carbon cloth as a hybrid anode for lithium-ion batteries
Silicon nanotubes were fabricated by using ZnO nanowire as a sacrificial template [18]. Typically, CC substrates (W0S1002, Phychemi Company Limited) were cut into small pieces (1-2 cm2), and then cleaned by sonication sequentially in acetone and alcohol for 10 min, respectively. The cleaned CC was then soaked in 0.0025 M zinc acetate dihydrate alcohol solution for 5 min and annealed in oven for 20 min at 300 degC to form a ZnO seed layer. A precursor 150 ml solution was prepared with 0.04 M zinc acetate dihydrate, 0.04 M hexamethylenetetramine and 0.009 M poly(ethylene imine). After preheating the precursor solution for 1 h at 95 degC, the seeded CC substrates were dipped into the solution for another 4 h and finally ZnO nanowire arrays were grown on the substrates. Subsequently, the substrates with ZnO nanowires were cleaned by deionized water and transferred into a chemical vapor deposition chamber to deposit a silicon shell. The deposition of silicon shell was achieved at 500 degC for several min with passing 4 sccm SiH4 and 20 sccm Ar at a pressure of 100 Pa. To form a carbon coating on the surface of silicon shell, another deposition process was carried out at 650 degC for 90 min with passing 4 sccm C2H2 and 20 sccm Ar at a pressure of 500 Pa. Finally, the core ZnO nanowires were selectively removed via a reduction process at 600 degC for 12 h with 20% H2 in N2 at 600 Pa, leaving a carbon-coated Si NT. For comparison, the sample of Si NT arrays/CC was prepared without carbon deposition process.
