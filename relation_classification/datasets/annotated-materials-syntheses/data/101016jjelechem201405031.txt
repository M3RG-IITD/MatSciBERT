Low pressure preparation of spherical Si@C@CNT@C anode material for lithium-ion batteries

Spherical Si@C@CNT@C multiple composite was prepared from Si powder. The detailed preparation process is described in Fig. 1. Firstly, 10 g Si powder was put in a chamber and vacuumed for 1 h. After that, 100 mL, 500 g L-1 glucose solution was added and the mixture was pyrolyzed at 650 degC for 5 h in an argon atmosphere. The obtained product was crushed to form Si@C composite and soaked in 0.5 mol L-1 Co(NO3)2 solution for 10 min. Then, the sample was filtrated and coated with CNT at 650 degC for 30 min by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using acetylene as carbon source. The as-prepared Si@C@CNT was put in the vacuum chamber and vacuumed for 1 h. To form spherical Si@C@CNT@C multiple composite, 10 g pitch was acted as the carbon source for outer layer. The as-obtained sample was pyrolyzed at 800 degC for 5 h in an argon atmosphere and then crushed into smaller particles and granulated by ball-milling. The final product was obtained after a washing by water to remove the dust.
