Selective oxidation of p-cymene catalyzed by VPO catalyst: Process performance and kinetics studies
Three distinctive standard methods were used to prepare the VPO catalyst precursors phase, VOHPO4*0.5H2O [14]. In the first method, the precursor was prepared in an aqueous medium by dissolving V2O5 (6.0 g; 33 mmol) in aqueous HCl (35%, 79 mL) and refluxing for 2 h. The H3PO4 (85%; 8.9 g; 78 mmol) was added and the solution refluxed for further 2 h. The solution was subsequently evaporated to dryness and the resulting solid was refluxed in water (20 mL H2O g-1 solid) for 1 h. It was then filtered hot, washed with warm water, and dried in air (110 degC, 16 h). The precursor prepared by this method is denoted P1.In the second method, the precursor was prepared in an organic medium, by adding V2O5 (11.8 g; 66 mmol) to isobutanol (250 mL). H3PO4 (85%; 16.4 g; 39 mmol) was then introduced and the whole mixture was refluxed for 16 h. The light blue suspension was then separated from the organic solution by filtration and washed with isobutanol (200 mL) and ethanol (150 mL, 100%). The resulting solid was refluxed in water (9 mL g-1 solid), filtered hot, and dried in air (110 degC, 16 h). The precursor prepared by this method is denoted P2. The third method precursor was prepared via the dihydrate compound VOPO4*2H2O. A mixture V2O5 (11.8 g; 66 mmol) and H3PO4 (85%; 115.5 g; 106 mmol) were refluxed in water (24 mL g-1 solid) for 8 h. The resulting VOPO4*2H2O was recovered by filtration and washed with a little water. Some of the VOPO4*2H2O (4.0 g; 20 mmol) was subsequently refluxed with isobutanol (80 mL) for 21 h, and the resulting solid was recovered by filtration and dried in air (110 degC, 16 h). The precursor prepared by this method is denoted P3. The precursors (P1, P2 and P3) were activated under N2 flow in the tube furnace at 550 degC for 4 h. They are denoted C1, C2 and C3, respectively.
