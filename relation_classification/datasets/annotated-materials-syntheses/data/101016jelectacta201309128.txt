Layered sodium titanate nanostructures as a new electrode for high energy density supercapacitors

Analytical reagent grade NaOH (R&M Chemicals, India), titanium tetra isopropoxide (TTIP) (Acros Organic, Germany) and methanol were the starting materials. Sodium titanate nanoflowers (STNFs) were synthesized via hydrothermal reaction between NaOH and a mixture of TTIP and methanol. In a typical synthesis, methanol (50 ml) was added to TTIP (3.0 g) and then heated up to ~67 degC with stirring. The above solution was hydrolyzed using distilled water (0.72 g) and subsequently heated for 30 min. Upon completion of the hydrolysis, NaOH (20 ml, 5 wt%) solution was added to the mixture which was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 80 degC (STNF80C) and 120 degC (STNF120C) for 24 h. Upon completion of the hydrothermal reaction, the precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water until pH ~9-10 was attained. For Na free TiO2, the STNF80C and the STNF120C samples were washed with 0.1 M HCl followed by distilled water until pH ~4 was obtained and subsequently dried at 70 degC for 1 h. The dried sample powder was then calcined at 500 degC for 3 h.
