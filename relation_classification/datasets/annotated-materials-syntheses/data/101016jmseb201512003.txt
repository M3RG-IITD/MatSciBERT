Sb2MoO6, Bi2MoO6, Sb2WO6, and Bi2WO6 flake-like crystals: Generalized hydrothermal synthesis and the applications of Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6 as red phosphors doped with Eu3+ ions
All chemicals are of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. In this work, for the sake of obtaining a series of Sb2MoO6, Bi2MoO6, Sb2WO6, and Bi2WO6 samples, all experiments were carried out in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 degC for 12 h by simply adjusting the initial molar ratios of SbCl3-to-NaOH (or BiCl3-to-NaOH) while keeping the initial molar ratio of SbCl3-to-Na2MoO4 (BiCl3-to-Na2MoO4, SbCl3-to-Na2WO4, or BiCl3-to-Na2WO4) as 2:1.

SbCl3 (2 mmol) and Na2MoO4*2H2O (1 mmol) were in turn added into 20 mL distilled H2O under magnetic stirring, resulting in dark green precipitates. After being stirred for 20 min, aqueous solution (20 mL) containing 4 mmol NaOH was gradually poured into the above suspension. Next, the above suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was then sealed and kept at 180 degC in an electrical oven. After 12 h, the resulting dark green product was filtered off, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol for several times, and then dried under vacuum at 60 degC for 6 h.
