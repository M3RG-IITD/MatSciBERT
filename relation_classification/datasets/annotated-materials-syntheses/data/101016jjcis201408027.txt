A controlled anion exchange strategy to synthesize core-shell β-bismuth oxide/bismuth sulfide hollow heterostructures with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity
All chemical reagents in our experiments were analytical and used as received without further purification. The synthesis of β-Bi2O3 hollow spheres adopted our previous method [21]. In a typical experiment, Bi(NO3)3*5H2O (2.91 g, 6 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solution of glycerol (30 mL) and ethanol (30 mL) under vigorous stirring. After 40 min of stirring, the solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated to 160 degC and maintained for 3 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the products were separated centrifugally and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times, and then dried under vacuum at 80 degC overnight. Finally, the products were further heated at 2 degC/min heating rate from room temperature to 270 degC and maintained at 270 degC for 2 h to obtain β-Bi2O3 hollow spheres.
The core/shell β-Bi2O3/Bi2S3 hollow heterostructure was synthesized by in situ anion-exchange method. In a typical process, the as-prepared β-Bi2O3 hollow microsphere (0.4660 g, 1 mmol) was dispersed in 50 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring. Then a certain amount CH3CSNH2 (0.0225 g, 0.3 mmol) was added into the solution. After 30 min of stirring at 50 degC, the precipitates were collected, washed and dried under vacuum at 80 degC for 6 h. By controlling the theoretical molar percentage of Bi2S3 to initial Bi2O3, different β-Bi2O3/Bi2S3 heterostructures were obtained. The final samples were labeled as the β-Bi2O3/Bi2S3 (5%, 10%, 25%) heterostructure.
