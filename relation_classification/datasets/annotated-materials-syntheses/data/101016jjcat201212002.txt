Catalytic performance of sheet-like Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites for the selective oxidation of benzene with nitrous oxide
Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets were prepared according to a literature procedure modified with the purpose of including Fe3+[25] and [26]. In a typical synthesis, 10.42 g of TEOS (tetraethylorthosilicate) was added to a solution containing 0.47 g of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, 0.06 g of iron nitrate nonahydrate, and 20.0 g of distilled water. The mixture was stirred for 2 h. A solution containing 2.41 g of C16-6-6(Br)2 or C16-6-6(OH)2, 0.42 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 15.7 g of demi-water was added to this mixture and shaken by hand for 5 min. After further stirring with a magnetic stirrer for 6 h at room temperature, the gel mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 140 degC for 9 days under tumbling (60 rpm). The zeolite product was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at 100 degC overnight. Using the OH form of the template, three different Si/Fe ratios were employed (Si/Fe = 84, 180 and 300). The as-synthesized zeolites were calcined at 580 degC for 4 h under a flow of air. The calcined samples were ion-exchanged into their ammonium form by triple ion-exchange with a 1 M aqueous solution of NH4NO3 at room temperature. The proton form of the zeolites was obtained by calcination at 550 degC under a flow of air for 4 h. The samples are denoted as Fe/ZSM-5-sheet(x, y) with x the anion of the template used (OH or Br) and y the Si/Fe ratio. Steam activation was carried out by heating an amount of sample in a flow of 10% water vapor (100 ml min-1) in artificial air at 700 degC for 3 h. The steamed samples are denoted by using the suffix "-st." A reference Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by controlled hydrolysis of TEOS in the presence of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) according to a literature procedure [10].
