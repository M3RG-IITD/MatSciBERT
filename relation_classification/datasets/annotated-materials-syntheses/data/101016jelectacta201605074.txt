Pd on carbon nanotubes-supported Ag for formate oxidation: The effect of Ag on anti-poisoning performance
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were obtained from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. and the average diameter of CNTs are 40 ~ 60 nm. Sodium oleate, potassium formate (HCOOK) and other reagents were of analytical purity and used without further purification.
The as-received CNTs (300 mg) were first ultrasonicated in HCl (1 M, 50 mL) for 1 h to dissolve possible metal residues, then filtered, washed, and dried to obtain purified CNTs. For deposition of Ag particles on CNTs, 210 mg of purified CNTs were dispersed in a beaker containing 253 mg sodium oleate and ultrasonicated for 30 min, and then aqueous solution containing 141 mg AgNO3 was added dropwise under magnetic stirring to form silver oleate on CNTs. After filteration and aqueous washing, the as-obtained sample of ~510 mg was collected and dried at 100 degC. Then 300 mg as-prepared samples were heated in a tube at 550 degC for 5 min under N2 protection to decompose the silver oleate. Finally 160 mg of Ag/CNTs was obtained with a theoretical Ag content of 30 wt. %.
