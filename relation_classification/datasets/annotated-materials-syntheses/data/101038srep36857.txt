Osteogenic and bactericidal surfaces from hydrothermal titania nanowires on titanium substrates
The Ti disk samples were prepared from a 0.9 mm thick ASTM grade 1 Ti sheet (Ti metals Ltd, UK). They were polished to a mirror image and ultrasonically cleaned in water and ethanol. Nanowires were created by immersing the Ti disks in 1 M NaOH in a PTFE lined steel vessel (Acid Digestion vessel 4748, Parr Instrument Company, USA), at a temperature of 240 degC for 2, 2.5 or 3 h. The vessel was removed after each time point from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The samples were rinsed in water and ethanol, sequentially and they were subsequently heat treated at 300 degC for 1 h prior to ion exchange in HCl. To convert the sodium titanate nanowires to TiO2 the samples were immersed in 0.6 M HCl for 1 h, rinsed in water and ethanol, and finally heat treated at 600 degC for 2 h.
