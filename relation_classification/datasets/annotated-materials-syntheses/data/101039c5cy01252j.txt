Superior performance of mesoporous tin oxide over nano and bulk forms in the activation of a carbonyl group: conversion of bio-renewable feedstock
The nano tin oxide was synthesized by the method as reported in the literature.34 In a typical procedure, 11.3 g of SnCl4*5H2O was dissolved in 25 ml of distilled water followed by the addition of an aqueous NaOH solution (7.5 g NaOH + 25 ml of H2O). To the above solution, 2.5 g of CTAB was added with continuous stirring for 1 h. The precipitated solution was hydrothermally treated at 150 degC for 4 h using a Teflon-lined autoclave. The obtained precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at 120 degC. The as-formed white solid was calcined to 400 and 500 degC. Bulk tin oxide was also prepared by the same procedure as given above without using the template. The tin oxide samples were designated as M-Y, where M stands for the meso, nano or bulk type material and Y is the calcination temperature.
