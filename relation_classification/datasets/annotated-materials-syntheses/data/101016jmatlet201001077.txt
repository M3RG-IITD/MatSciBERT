Polycrystalline SnO2 nanowires coated with amorphous carbon nanotube as anode material for lithium ion batteries

The preparation process for the nanowire arrays of the polycrystalline SnO2 coated with amorphous carbon nanotube is shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, The AAO templates were prepared as described [12]. High-purity aluminum (0.2 mm in thickness, 99.99%) was washed sequentially with acetone, ethanol, and distilled water. After annealing in Ar flow at 430 degC for 4 h, aluminum plates were anodized in 0.3 M oxalic acid under direct current voltage of 40 V at 15 degC. The remaining aluminum was etched in 1 M CuCl2 solution. The bottom part of the AAO was removed and the pore diameter was adjusted in 5 wt.% H3PO4 solution at 30 degC for 80 min. SnCl2*2H2O (1.13 g) was dissolved in 1.5 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid and kept at rest for 3 h to get a clear solution. Then 1.16 g citric acid and 1 ml H2O were added into the solution and dissolved. Ammonia was dropwise added to the clear mixture to adjust pH value to 2. Then the mixture was continuously stirred at 50 degC. At last, a 0.5 M SnO2 sol was obtained after the volume was adjusted. AAO templates were dipped into the clear sol for 1 h. Then the sol-filled AAO were kept at 80 degC for 10 h to complete the sol-gel transition. The gel-filled membranes were heated in air in a muffle furnace at 450 degC for 4 h and then cooled to room temperature. After the annealing, the sample was immersed in 1 M NaOH solution for 4 h to move the AAO template at room temperature, through which free-standing SnO2 nanowires were obtained. SnO2 powder was synthesized as a control. It was prepared by directly drying the above-mentioned 0.5 M SnO2 sol following the annealing at 450 degC for 4 h and grinding.
