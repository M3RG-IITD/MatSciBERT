Enhanced thermoelectric performance of Ag0.8Pb18SbTe20 alloyed with Se
The Ag0.8Pb18SbTe20-xSex samples were prepared with tellurium (99.999% purity), lead (99.9%), antimony (99.999%), silver (99.9%), and selenium (99.95%) powders as sources, which were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio. After being uniformly mixed in an agate mortar under argon protection inside a glove box, the mixtures were pressed into a disk with diameter of 10 mm and height of 4 mm. The pole-shaped samples were assembled for high-pressure synthesis. The Ag0.8Pb18SbTe20-xSex compounds were prepared in a cubic anvil high-pressure apparatus (SPD 6 x 1200T) with a sample chamber of 23 mm on an edge at 1200-1300 K and 4.0 GPa. The temperature and pressure were maintained for 20 min. After that, the electrical power for heating was cut off and the pressure was released. The pressure was estimated by the oil press load, which was calibrated by the pressure-induced phase transitions of bismuth, thallium, and barium metals. The temperature was estimated by the relationship of input heater power and temperature, which was measured by the platinum-rhodium thermocouples.
