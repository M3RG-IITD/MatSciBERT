Strength and microstructure of water treatment residue-based geopolymers containing heavy metals
Geopolymer was synthesized from calcined WTR with an initial SiO2:Al2O3 ratio of 1.78. Analytical-grade NaOH solution from Merck was reacted with calcined and non-calcined WTR at an Na2O:Si2O ratio of 0.25. The proportion of each mixture is shown in Table 2. The water used for each mixture was determined using ASTM Method C 187-68 [2]. NaOH was dissolved in the water mixture and then added to the solid mixture and mixed for 15 min to homogenize the sample. The mixtures were then transferred to cylindrical PVC molds (diameter 35 mm, height 70 mm), and vibrated for 2 min to remove entrapped air bubbles. The samples were demolded after 24 h, wrapped with cling film to prevent the loss of water and allowed to cure at an ambient temperature of 28 +- 2 degC. The development of strength and the characteristics of the microstructure were used to understand the geopolymerization reaction between the WTR and NaOH. The optimum calcining temperature of the WTR was determined according to the development of strength in the specimens and was used to prepare WTR for further study of metal immobilization. EPS was added to the binders (WTR and NaOH) at 0%, 30%, and 50% by weight.
