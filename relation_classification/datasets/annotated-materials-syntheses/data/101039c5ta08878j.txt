A robust symmetrical electrode with layered perovskite structure for direct hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells: PrBa 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 2 O 5+δ
In order to fabricate a La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ (LSGM) electrolyte supported cell, the LSGM powder was prepared by the solid state reaction method and a dense electrolyte substrate was prepared by dry pressing followed by sintering at 1475 degC. Stoichiometric amounts of La2O3 (Sigma 99.99%), SrCO3 (Sigma, 99.99%), Ga2O3 (Sigma, 99.99%), and MgO (Sigma, 99.9%) powders were ball milled in ethanol for 24 h. After drying, the mixture was calcined for 6 h. The thickness of the LSGM electrolyte was adjusted to about 250 μm by polishing. LDC (La0.4Ce0.6O2-δ) was also prepared by ball milling stoichiometric amounts of La2O3 and CeO2 (Sigma, 99.99%) in ethanol and then calcined for 6 h. For the preparation of the electrode slurry, disordered Pr0.5Ba0.4Ca0.1MnO3 was mixed with an organic binder, V-006. The Pr0.5Ba0.4Ca0.1MnO3 slurry was applied on both sides of the LSGM pellet by the screen printing method, and then fired at 950 degC in air for 4 h.
