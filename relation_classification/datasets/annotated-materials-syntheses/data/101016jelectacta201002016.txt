Surfactant-templated sol-gel silica thin films bearing 5-mercapto-1-methyl-tetrazole on carbon electrode for Hg(II) detection
Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 98%) were purchased from Fluka. The MTTZ-siloxy derivative (triethoxysilyl-propyl-5-mercapto-1-methyl-tetrazole) was synthesized as previously described [38] and its structure (Scheme 1) confirmed by 13C and 1H NMR. Ethanol (95-96%, Merck) and HCl (37%, Aldrich) were used for precursor hydrolysis and film deposition, as well as for extraction of the surfactant template. Ru(NH3)6Cl3 (Aldrich), K3Fe(CN)6 (Fluka) and Fc(MeOH)2 (Alfa Aesar) have been used as redox probes, usually in solutions containing potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP, Merck) as supporting electrolyte. Analytical grade Hg(NO3)2 (Prolabo) and HNO3 (65%, Merck) were used for the preparation of diluted mercury solutions; their concentration was checked using a certified standard solution (Hg2+ 1.001 +- 0.002 g L-1 in HNO3 3 M, Merck). All solutions were prepared with high-purity water (18 MΩ cm) from a millipore milli-Q water purification system.

MTTZ-modified silica films were deposited by spin-coating on freshly polished surfaces of glassy carbon electrode (GCE, purchased from EG&G, Princeton Applied Research), according to a procedure adapted from Ref. [43]. The sol solutions were typically prepared by heating a mixture of 2.08 g TEOS (including selected equivalent fractions of MTTZ derivative, from 0 to 20% relative to TEOS), 5.5 g EtOH, 0.5 g water and 0.4 g of a 0.1 M HCl solution, at 70 degC for 1 h. 0.78 g of CTAB dissolved in 10 g of EtOH was then added to this mixture, which was stirred again for 1 h at room temperature. GCE surfaces have been carefully polished before deposition of the film, using successively alumina suspensions made of Al2O3 powders (Buehler) of 1, 0.3 and 0.05 μm particle sizes; they were then washed with ethanol and water. Hundred microliters of sol (prepared as above) was deposited on the electrode surface, and left 30 s before the electrode was rotated at 7000 rpm for 30 s (optimized values). This was performed using a disk electrode rotator (model 636, EG&G, Princeton Applied Research). The spin-coated films were then treated for 20 min at 60 degC. The extraction of the surfactant was performed in an ethanol solution containing 0.1 M HCl under stirring conditions for 15 min. The film electrodes were used in the electrochemical experiments without further treatment.
