Hydrothermal chemistry of vanadium oxides with aromatic di- and tri-phosphonates in the presence of secondary metal copper(II) cationic complex subunits
All chemicals were used as obtained without further purification: vanadium(V) oxide, copper(II) acetate hydrate, copper(II) nitrate hydrate, 2,2'-dipyridine, 2,2'-dipyridylamine, 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,2':6,2''-terpyridine, and hydrofluoric acid (48 to 51%) were purchased from Aldrich. The phosphonate ligands 1,4-phenyldiphosphonic acid, 1,3-phenyldiphosphonic acid, and 1,3,5-phenyltriphosphonic acid were prepared according to the literature method.57 The copper mononucleating ligand 2-pyridylcarboxylic acid was prepared by refluxing 2-cyanopyridine in concentrated HCl overnight, and subsequent removal of excess liquid. All syntheses were carried out in 23mL poly(tetrafluoroethylene) lined stainless steel containers under autogenous pressure. The reactants were stirred briefly and initial pH was measured before heating. Water was distilled above 3.0 M Î© in-house using a Barnstead Model 525 Biopure Distilled Water Center. The reactions initial and final pH was measured using Hydrion pH sticks.
