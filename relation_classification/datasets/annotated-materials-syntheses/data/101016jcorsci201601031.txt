The influence of the high Fe and Cr contents of Alloy 800 on its inter- and intragranular oxidation tendency in 480degC hydrogenated steam
Alloy 800 was purchased from Rolled Alloys Inc. as a 1.3 mm thick plate; Table 1 reports the composition of the material. The material was cut into flat coupons measuring 1 cm by 1 cm. Coupons were solution annealed at 1050 degC in Ar-5% H2 gas for one hour and immediately water quenched to ensure complete dissolution of carbides and homogeneous composition.
Samples were ground with 400, 800, and 1200 grit paper. Following this, coupons were fine polished using diamond paste (9 μm, 3 μm, and 1 μm) and then with alumina suspension to a 0.05 μm finish. Coupons were ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and de-ionized water for 10 minutes each between polishing stages and dried with air. A desiccator was used to store samples until time of exposure.
