TiN Nanoparticles on CNT-Graphene Hybrid Support as Noble-Metal-Free Counter Electrode for Quantum-Dot-Sensitized Solar Cells
TiCl4 (1 g) was dispersed in ethanol (2.53 mL), and urea (1583 mg), a nitrogen source, was added to the solution. The metal precursor/urea molar ratio was 1:5. After stirring for 1 h, a viscous metal-urea complex was transferred to a tubular furnace and calcined at 750 degC for 3 h under a N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 100 mL s-1.
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by applying the Hummer's method,42 and CNTs were purchased from Hanwha Nanotech (CMP-310F). GO, CNT, and a mixture of GO and CNTs (1:1 w/w) were used as starting materials for the syntheses of supports. The amount of Ti was fixed to 60 wt % in supported TiN catalysts. Thus, a solution of TiCl4 (1 g) in ethanol (2.53 mL) was dispersed ultrasonically in a solution of support material (GO, CNT, or CNT-GO, 120 mg) in ethanol (15 mL). After vigorous stirring for 1 h in the presence of urea (1583 mg), the resulting solution was dried in an oven at 100 degC to evaporate excess ethanol. After heat treatment under the same conditions as those used for the synthesis of TiN, supported TiN NPs were obtained.
