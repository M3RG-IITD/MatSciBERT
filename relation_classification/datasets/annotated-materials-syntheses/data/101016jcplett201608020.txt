High catalytic activity of magnetic CuFe2O4/graphene oxide composite for the degradation of organic dyes under visible light irradiation
CuFe2O4/GO (20 wt%) was synthesized by a hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis, 60 mg of GO was dispersed in 40 mL deionized water with sonication for 1 h. The mixture of 0.200 g Cu(CH3COO)2*H2O, 0.811 g Fe(NO3)3*9H2O and 20 ml deionized water was then added to GO aqueous solution dropwise and stirred for 1 h. The pH value of this suspension was adjusted to 10.0 using 6 M NaOH solution. After stirring for 30 min, the suspension solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed and intained at 220 degC for 18 h. The final products were centrifugated and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 degC.
