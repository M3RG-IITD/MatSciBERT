Facile method to synthesize a carbon layer embedded into titanium dioxide nanotubes with metal oxide decoration for electrochemical applications
TiO2 nanotube layers were prepared by electrochemical anodization of Ti. For this, Ti foils (0.1 mm thickness, 99.6% purity) were firstly degreased by sonication in ethanol, followed by thoroughly rinsing with deionized (DI) water and drying with a nitrogen stream. The Ti foils were used as the working electrode, and a platinum gauze served as the counter electrode. After the anodization in an electrolyte of ethylene glycol (EG) containing 0.135 M NH4F and 1 M H2O at 50 V for 6 h, the samples were washed in a bath of DI water for 1 min to remove the organic electrolyte on the sample surface and then annealed in an argon (Ar) atmosphere at 450 degC for 1 h. To prepare the anatase TiO2 NTs without carbon grafting, the as-prepared samples were dipped into ethanol for 24 h, and then annealed in air at 450 degC for 3 h.
