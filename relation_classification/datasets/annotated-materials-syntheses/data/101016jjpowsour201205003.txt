SnO2 nanospheres supported Pd catalyst with enhanced performance for formic acid oxidation

K2SnO3*3H2O (99.9%), glucose (99%) and Na2PdCl4 (Pd 36.4%) were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. Vulcan XC-72 carbon black was purchased from Cabot Corporation. NaBH4 (98%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Pd/C (20% Pd on carbon, Johnson Matthey) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Nafion (5 wt.%) was purchased from Sigam-Aldrich. Water used throughout all experiments was purified with the Millipore system.

The SnO2 nanospheres were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction of K2SnO3 in an aqueous glucose solution followed by calcination at 400 degC in air [18]. The SnO2 supported Pd catalyst was prepared through reduction of Na2PdCl4 with NaBH4. In a typical procedure, 50 mg of SnO2 was dispersed in 50 mL of water by sonication. Then, 2 mL of Na2PdCl4 solution (0.06 mM) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. A freshly prepared 10 mL of NaBH4 solution (0.1 M) was added to the solution at 0 degC, followed by stirring at room temperature overnight. Finally, it was filtered, washed with water and ethanol, and vacuum-dried at 70 degC for 6 h. The as-prepared product was denoted as Pd/SnO2-S. For comparison, the commercial SnO2 nanopowder and Vulcan XC-72 carbon black supported Pd catalyst with same Pd loading was prepared by the above procedure, which were denoted as Pd/SnO2-P and Pd/XC-72, respectively.
