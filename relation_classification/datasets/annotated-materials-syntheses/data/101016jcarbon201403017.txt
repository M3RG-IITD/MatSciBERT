High-capacity graphene oxide/graphite/carbon nanotube composites for use in Li-ion battery anodes
All chemical reagents used to prepare graphene oxide were analytical grade (purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemicals Co., Ltd.) and used as received. Graphene oxide was synthesized from high-purity natural graphite flakes (about 200 meshes, 99.999% purity; Changsha Shenghua Research Institute) using the Hummers method [11]. In a typical synthesis, 5 g of natural graphite flakes was added to 115 ml of H2SO4 (98%) with vigorous stirring in an ice bath. Then, 15 g KMnO4 was slowly added to the reaction vessel five times. Afterwards, 230 ml of deionized water and 30 ml of H2O2 were added to the suspension. The ice bath was removed and then subjected to centrifugal separation and repeated washing using dilute hydrochloric acid and deionized water. The colloidal dispersion of the as-synthesized graphene oxide in deionized water at a concentration of 1 mg ml-1 was prepared with the aid of ultrasonication (20 kHz ultrasound probe) for about 15 min until stabilization and browning of the dispersion.
