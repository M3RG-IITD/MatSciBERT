Synthesis of porous Co3O4 nanoflake array and its temperature behavior as pseudo-capacitor electrode

Cobalt nitrate [Co(NO3)2*6(H2O)], hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) and potassium hydroxide were of analytical grade and used without further purification. All aqueous solutions were freshly prepared with deionized water. The nickel foam substrate with a size of 2 cm x 3 cm was cleaned ultrasonically in ethanol for 10 min. Its top side was protected from solution contamination by uniformly coating with a polytetrafluoroethylene tape. The reaction bath for the deposition of Co(OH)2 precursor contained 0.2 M Co(NO3)2*6(H2O), and 0.1 M C6H12N4. The cleaned nickel foam substrates were immersed vertically in the deposition bath. Deposition was carried out at 100 degC for 5 h. After the deposition, the precursor films were washed by deionized water and alcohol, dried in oven at 60 degC, and then heated in a tube furnace at 250 degC for 2 h in flowing argon to obtain final product Co3O4. The average loading of Co3O4 is determined to be 3.4 mg cm-2, which is calculated by measuring the nickel foam substrate before and after the deposition via a DENVER TB-25 analytical balance.
