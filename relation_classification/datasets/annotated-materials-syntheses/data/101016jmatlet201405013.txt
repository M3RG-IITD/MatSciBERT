Hydrothermal synthesis of variety low dimensional WS2 nanostructures

Synthesis of samples: All chemical reagents were of analytic purity and applied directly without further purification. First, sodium tungstate (Na2WO4*2H2O) (0.005 mol), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH*HCl) (0.01 mol), sulfourea (CH4N2S) (0.02 mol) were dissolved in 30 ml deionized water. The surfactants were then added into the solution under constant stirring. The pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 6 by dropping 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid (HCl) or ammonia water (NH3*H2O). The final solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed and treated at 180 degC for 24 h. The products obtained were black in color. After calcination, the as-prepared samples were washed several times with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and dried in air at 60 degC for 10 h. To better describe the samples, the precipitates using no additive was named sample I, while powders obtained with the addition of CTAB (0.18 g, 0.24 g) and PEG (0.18 g ) were named as sample II, III and IV, respectively, as shown in Table 1.
