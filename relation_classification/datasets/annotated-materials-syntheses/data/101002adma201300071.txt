Binding SnO 2 Nanocrystals in Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Sheets as Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries
Fabrication of graphite oxide: The graphite oxide was produced from natural graphite flakes (Alfa Aesar, 325 mesh) by a modified Hummers method.57
Synthesis of SnO2 nanocrystal aqueous suspension: 2.0 g SnCl4*5H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was first dissolved in 100 mL deionized (DI) water. The resulting solution was then transferred to two 100 mL poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon)-lined stainless steel autoclaves and heated in an oven at 120 degC for 28 h to produce a white precipitate, which was harvested by centrifugation and dispersed in 35 mL DI water to achieve a SnO2 nanocrystal aqueous suspension with a concentration of 20 mg mL-1.
Synthesis of SnO2 nanocrystal/nitrogen-doped RGO hybrid (SnO2NC@N-RGO): Typically, 10 mL of graphite oxide aqueous suspension (10.0 mg mL-1) was dispersed in DI water (90 mL), followed by addition of the above SnO2 nanocrystal aqueous suspension (10 mL). The mixture was continuously sonicated to form a homogeneous suspension. After lyophilization (freeze-drying), 300 mg of the obtained gray powder (SnO2 nanocrystals/graphene oxide hybrid) was put into a small glass beaker, which was further placed in a glass bottle containing 6 mL of hydrazine monohydrate (Alfa Aesar, 99%), without direct contact between the powder and the hydrazine monohydrate. After sealing, the glass bottle was maintained at 120 degC for 2 h to reduce the graphene oxide in situ. After cooling, the product was washed with water six times to remove the adsorbed hydrazine monohydrate and byproducts, followed by drying at 120 degC under vacuum for 20 h to obtain the final hybrid SnO2NC@N-RGO.
Synthesis of SnO2 nanocrystal/RGO hybrid (SnO2NC@ RGO): SnO2NC@RGO was synthesized following the same procedure as for SnO2NC@N-RGO except that 300 mg of the gray powder was reduced by thermal reduction in a tube furnace at 500 degC for 2 h under Ar flow with a heating rate of 2 degC min-1 and no washing and subsequent drying were needed.
Synthesis of nitrogen-doped RGO (N-RGO): N-RGO was produced using the same procedure as for SnO2NC@N-RGO except that SnO2 nanocrystals were not added.
Synthesis of a physical mixture of SnO2 nanocrystals and N-RGO (SnO2NC + N-RGO mixture): 30 mg N-RGO was dispersed in 100 mL DI water, followed by addition of the above SnO2 nanocrystal aqueous suspension (3.5 mL). The mixture was sonicated for 1 h and subsequently freeze-dried to generate SnO2NC + N-RGO mixture.
Synthesis of SnO2 nanocrystal/N-RGO composite by means of hydrazine monohydrate aqueous solution reduction (SnO2NC/N-RGO-HS): SnO2NC/N-RGO-HS was prepared following the same procedure as for SnO2NC@N-RGO except that the gray powder was reduced by hydrazine aqueous solution. 150 mg of the gray powder was mixed with 200 mL DI water and 200 Î¼L hydrazine monohydrate (Alfa Aesar, 99%) in a 500 mL flask. After the mixture had been vigorously stirred, the flask was heated in an oil bath (100 degC) for 1 h, followed by freeze-drying to obtain the product SnO2NC/N-RGO-HS.
