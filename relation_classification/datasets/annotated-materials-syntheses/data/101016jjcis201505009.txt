Efficient activation of peroxymonosulfate by manganese oxide for the degradation of azo dye at ambient condition

All chemicals were of analytical purity, which were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China, and used without further purification. The MnOx catalysts were prepared using a simple coprecipitation method. In a typical procedure, Mn(NO3)2 (50%, v/v) solution was diluted with deionized water to 2.5%, and then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 9, 9.5, 10, 11, and 13 by dropwise adding an aqueous solution NaOH (2 mol/L) under magnetic stirring (200 rpm), respectively. The solution was kept stirring for half an hour. Subsequent precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water for three times, and were dried at 70 degC for 6 h. The as-obtained samples were noted as M-9, M-9.5, M-10, M-11 and M-13, respectively. The Mn-10 sample was chosen to be further calcined at 400, 600, 800 and 1000 degC with a heat rate of 10 degC /min followed by slow cooling to room temperature because precipitate was rarely generated when the pH of the solution was below 10. The as-obtained samples were named hereinafter as M-10-400, M-10-600, M-10-800 and M-10-1000.
