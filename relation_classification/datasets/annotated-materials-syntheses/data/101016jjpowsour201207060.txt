Synthesis of cage-like LiFePO4/C microspheres for high performance lithium ion batteries

All chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 0.015 mol of Li2SO4, 0.01 mol of Fe(NO3)3*9H2O and 0.005 mol of P2O5 were added in a Teflon vessel together with 40 mL ethylene glycol (EG) and 20 mL deionized water. After vigorous stirring for 0.5 h, the vessel was sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave, then placed inside an oven and heated at 180 degC for 24 h. Afterward, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation and dried at 80 degC for 72 h in vacuum atmosphere. The obtained product was calcined at 600 degC under flowing Ar/H2 atmosphere (100 mL min-1, 95 vol. % Ar and 5 vol. % H2) for 10 h, and for the carbon coating, the gas was then switched to C2H4/Ar (20 mL min-1, 50 vol. % C2H4 and 50 vol. % Ar) for 15 min. To investigate the formation process of the cage-like LPCs, time-dependent experiments were carefully conducted. And the experimental parameters, such as the phosphate sources and the solvent, were also varied during the synthesis to study their effects on the shape of the final product. Commercial LiFePO4/C sample (particle size around 2-3 Î¼m, carbon content about 5.2%) was purchased from Tianjin Sterlan-Energy Ltd., China.
