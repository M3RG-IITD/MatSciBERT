Aluminium hydroxide waste based geopolymer composed of fly ash for sustainable cement materials
Geopolymerization was conducted for Al-waste and FA, when the wastes were mixed with aqueous NaOH solutions of 5, 10, and 15 M concentrations. Sodium silicate solutions containing 10.15% Na2O, 31.38% SiO2, and 58.47% H2O were used as alkaline activators. For all mixtures, the weight of the sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide solution was fixed at 2.5 for fly ash based geopolymer [11]. In this case, the Al-waste was heated at 110 degC for 24 h and then sieved through a 100 mesh screen before use. As presented in Table 2, different contents of the mixtures of FA and the Al-waste were used for 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 wt% for the Al-waste at different NaOH concentrations. First, the sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and NaOH solutions were premixed in each plastic container and were then left until the solutions reached room temperature. In the four mixed proportions of the Al-waste described above, geopolymerization was conducted using 5, 10 or 15 M NaOH solutions.
