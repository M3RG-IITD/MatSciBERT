Surface modification of Mg-doped spinel with different Li-containing manganese oxides
All the chemicals used here were purchased from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (AR, 99 %). Mn(CH3COO)2*4H2O, MgSO4*7H2O, Ni (CH3COO)2*4H2O, and LiOH*H2O were used as starting materials. At first, an stoichiometric amount of Mn(CH3COO)2*4H2O and MgSO4*7H2O (cationic ratio of Mn:Mg = 1.95:0.05, Mn-Mg solution) was dissolved completely in deionized water for Mg-doped spinel precursor; a mixture solution of Ni(CH3COO)2*4H2O with Mn(CH3COO)2*4H2O (cationic ratio of Ni:Mn = 0.5:1.5, Ni-Mn solution) was prepared for LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 coating layer, and a saturated LiOH*H2O solution was also prepared as precipitant avoiding incorporating impurity in case other precipitant is used. Then the Mn-Mg solution was dropped into the LiOH*H2O solution in a flask under continuously stirring in a N2 atmosphere. For the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-coated spinel, after the coprecipitate Mg0.05Mn1.95(OH)4 formed, the Ni-Mn solution was then dropped into the above coprecipitate suspension to obtain Mg0.05Mn1.95(OH)4-Ni0.5Mn1.5(OH)4 coprecipitate, followed by the same treatment as that for the bare spinel. To obtain the Li2Mn4O9-coated and Li4Mn5O12-coated spinels, two different stoichiometric aqueous solutions of Mn(CH3COO)2*4H2O were dropped into the above-prepared coprecipitate Mg0.05Mn1.95(OH)4 suspensions to get Mg0.05Mn1.95(OH)4-Mn(OH)2 coprecipitate. After dropping was finished, the suspension with Mg0.05Mn1.95(OH)4 coprecipitate coated with and without three different layers formed and then aged for 1 day. These suspensions were then filtered to get the sediment followed by washing with deionized water until the pH value degraded to 7, indicating that there is no residual Li ion inside the precursor. The sediments were then heated at 500 degC for 5 h in air to form a composite oxide. After mixing with 3 % excessive in molar ratio of LiOH*H2O, the powder was calcined at 750 degC for 10 h to obtain the final bare spinel LiMg0.05Mn1.95O4, the Li2Mn4O9-coated, Li4Mn5O12-coated, and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-coated LiMg0.05Mn1.95O4 spinels. All the coated layers were in a ratio of 3 wt.%.
