Vertical MgZnO Schottky ultraviolet photodetector with Al doped MgZnO transparent electrode
The MgZnO:Al thin film was grown on a commercial c-plane sapphire substrate by using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technique. A ceramic target with 45 wt.% MgO, 54.81 wt.% ZnO and 0.19 wt.% Al2O3 was used. The ceramic target was made by the Northeast Normal University. The sputtering rate is about 5 nm/min and the chamber pressure was maintained at 1.8 Pa. Oxygen with 20 sccm flow rate and argon with 40 sccm flow rate were used as the sputtering gas. Growth temperature was 400 degC and the RF power was 90 W. The thickness of the as-grown film was 300 nm. Then the as-grown MgZnO:Al films were vacuum annealed for 1 h in different temperatures to reduce the resistivity of the MgZnO:Al thin film, in order to meet the requirement of the device.
