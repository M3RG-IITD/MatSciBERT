Multilayer graphene films as transparent electrodes for organic photovoltaic devices
To prepare the MLG electrode on glass for OSCs, a thin layer of graphene was grown on Cu foils using CVD [23]. Cu foils were placed inside of a quartz tube furnace and heated to 1000 degC, with 4 s.c.c.m. of flowing H2 at 400 mTorr. After annealing the Cu foils for 30 min at 1000 degC, graphene was synthesized with a flowing gas mixture of 20 s.c.c.m. CH4 and 4 s.c.c.m. H2 at 900 mTorr for 30 min. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was used as a supporting layer in the transfer of a thin layer of graphene from the Cu foils to glass substrates. PMMA was spin coated at 1000 rpm on graphene/Cu, and the underlying Cu was etched with an appropriate Cu etchant. The PMMA/graphene layer was rinsed with deionized (DI) water to remove the residual etchant and amorphous carbon on the surface. The PMMA/graphene layer was then gently placed onto the glass substrate. The PMMA/graphene/glass substrate was dipped into acetone for a while to remove the PMMA layer and was subsequently rinsed with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and DI water. The transfer process was repeated four times to prepare the MLG films on the transparent glass substrate [24].
