Microwave assisted hydrothermal synthesis of single crystalline ZnO nanorods for gas sensor application

ZnO nanorods were synthesized similar to our previous work with a little modification [11]. In a typical procedure, Zn(NO3)2*6H2O (Reagent Grade, 98% Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water to make 0.1 M solution. Ammonia water was added to this solution to make pH 7, followed by vigorous stirring for 1 h. A white precipitate (Zn(OH)2) was produced which was collected by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with deionized water. Then the precipitate was transferred into 35 ml water containing 0.1 M of CTAB (Aldrich) and charged in a 100 ml capacity autoclave with Teflon liner. Microwave assisted hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 150 degC for 1 h in microwave oven (MARS; CEM). After completion of the reaction, it was cooled to room temperature and powder sample was collected by centrifugation. Powdered sample was thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol. Finally, sample was dried at 80 degC for 12 h.
