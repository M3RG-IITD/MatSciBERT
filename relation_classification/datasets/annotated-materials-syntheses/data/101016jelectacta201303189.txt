Influence of organic nitrogenous compounds phenothiazine and diphenyl amine in poly(vinylidene fluoride) blended with poly(ethylene oxide) polymer electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells
0.3 g of polymer blend, PVdF (0.23 g)-PEO (0.07 g), was dissolved in 25 ml of dimethyl formamide (DMF) under continuous stirring at 353 K. After about 2 h, 0.03 g of KI, 0.007 g of I2 and 0.007 g organic nitrogenous compounds (DPA in one portion and PT in another portion) were added. The polymer solution was stirred continuously for another 2 h until a homogenous viscous liquid was formed. The polymer blend solutions were then cast on to a petridish and vacuum dried at 333 K for 15 h to enable solvent evaporation.
