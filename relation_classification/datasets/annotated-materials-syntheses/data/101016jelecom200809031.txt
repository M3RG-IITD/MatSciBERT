Anthraquinone-ferrocene film electrodes: Utility in pH and oxygen sensing
All chemicals were supplied by Aldrich Chemical Co. and used as received. The buffered solutions were prepared as follows: pH 7 disodium hydrogen phosphate (0.025 M) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.025 M), pH 9 (0.05 M sodium tetraborate), all other pH solutions were prepared using a Britton-Robinson buffer (0.04 M boric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid) and adjusted to the appropriate pH with NaOH solution.
The synthesis of this compound and corresponding spectral data has been reported in the literature [14]. Briefly, to a solution of Ferrocene (1 g, 4.23 mmol) in dry diethyl ether (30 ml) was added portion wise Fast Red Al Salt (1.2 g, 4.43 mmol). The solution was stirred under N2 atm. for 48 h. Water (50 ml) was added to this solution and the organic phase was separated and dried over dry MgSO4. The solvent was then evaporated under vacuum and the residue was purified through basic alumina chromatography column using a gradient of petroleum ether (40-60 degC) and diethyl ether as eluent to give the desired compound in 30% yield.
