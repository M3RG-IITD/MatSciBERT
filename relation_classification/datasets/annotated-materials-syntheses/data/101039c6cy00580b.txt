New insights into how Pd nanoparticles influence the photocatalytic oxidation and reduction ability of g-C3N4 nanosheets
All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade (Sigma-Aldrich). Typically, 16 g of urea was placed into a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover and was heated in air at a rate of 15 degC min-1 to reach 550 degC. After being heated at 550 degC for 2 h, the obtained g-C3N4 was well ground in an agate mortar and was denoted as C3N4 in various characteristic figures below. To prepare C3N4-Pd composites, 1.0 g of the as-prepared g-C3N4 was added into 100 mL of ethanol and was sonicated for 2 h to obtain thin g-C3N4 nanosheets. The resultant was dried at 60 degC. Then, 1 g of the dried thin g-C3N4 nanosheets was added into 100 mL of H2O and was kept stirring for 30 min. Then, an appropriate amount of Pd(NO3)2 dissolved in 30 mL of H2O was added dropwise into the above suspension. Next, a certain amount of NaBH4 (according to the molar ratio of n(Pd(NO3)2):n(NaBH4) = 1:5) dissolved in 30 mL of H2O was added into the above suspension. After stirring for 10 min, the resulted suspension was aged for 2 h. Finally, the resulted grey products were collected by filtration, washed with water and ethanol four times and dried at 60 degC to obtain the final products. Depending on the ratio of n(Pd):n(C3N4) = 1%, 3%, 5% and 10%, the products were labelled as C3N4-Pd-1%, C3N4-Pd-3%, C3N4-Pd-5%, and C3N4-Pd-10%, respectively.
