Polymer-Assisted Direct Deposition of Uniform Carbon Nanotube Bundle Networks for High Performance Transparent Electrodes
Arc-discharge carbon nanotubes are purchased from ILJIN Nanotech, grade ASP-100F; 80 mg of these tubes is mixed with 2 g of J.T. Baker sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 200 mL of Invitrogen 0.1 μm filtered ultrapure water. This mixture is placed in an ice water bath and sonicated in a Cole-Parmer ultrasonic cup-horn sonicator for 30 min at 750 W. After sonication, the dispersion is centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 4 h at 4 degC in a Sorvall RC5C Plus centrifuge, and the supernatant decanted. The supernatant is diluted with anhydrous acetone, which dissociates the SDS from the nanotubes, and centrifuged to collect the precipitated tubes. This process of acetone rinsing followed by precipitate collection is repeated four times. Finally, the mixture is filtered through a Millipore 0.45 μm pore size PTFE membrane to collect the nanotubes. The tubes form a sheet on top of the filter, which is then peeled off and dried at 50 degC under vacuum overnight.

One to 1.5 mg of the SWNTs prepared during nanotube purification is dispersed in chloroform at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, by sonicating at 180 W for 30 min in an ice bath, using the same Cole-Parmer ultrasonic cup-horn sonicator as during the purification step. Separately, a few mg of rr-P3HT from Sigma Aldrich is dissolved in 4 mL of chloroform under gentle heating and shaking. The relevant quantity of rr-P3HT is then added to 2 mL of the nanotube dispersion using a glass microliter syringe, and the mixture is again sonicated at 180 W for 30-60 min, until the suspension is uniform to the eye. The total volume of solution is then refreshed to 2 mL by adding additional chloroform.

A 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm cut display-grade TFT glass (Eagle glass by Corning) is cleaned by placing in chloroform and then in a Branson 3510 100 W/42 kHz ultrasonic cleaner for 10 min, then switching the solvent to ethanol and repeating. This is followed by drying the substrates under a nitrogen stream and placing them in a Jelight Model 42 UV-Ozone cleaner for 20 min. A substrate is set spinning at 7000 rpm, and the predetermined amount of solution is dropped, one drop at a time, onto the substrate using a glass pipet. After spin-coating, the back of the substrate is cleaned with methanol, and the sample is annealed at about 120 degC on a hot plate, soaked in chloroform for an additional 10 min, and dried to remove any accessible excess polymer.
