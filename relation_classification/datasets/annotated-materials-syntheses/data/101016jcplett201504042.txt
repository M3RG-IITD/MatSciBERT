Synthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles doped reduced graphene oxide

Graphite oxide was first synthesized from the precursor graphite (natural graphite, Sigma Aldrich) by the modified Brodie method as described elsewhere [17] and [18]. The graphite oxide powder of 1 g was mixed with deionized (DI) water of 1 ml and stirred for 12 h for the GO solution. Then, the colloidal silver powder (from Sigma-Aldrich, 75% Ag basis) of 0.002 g were added to the GO solution and sonicated for 1 h followed by dropping hydrazine hydrate of 0.2 Î¼l and stirring for 3 h at 90 degC to reduce GO. The mixture was then filtered several times with DI water and kept in a vacuum oven for overnight. The obtained reduced GO with and without the Ag powder are named as RGO_Ag and RGO, respectively.
