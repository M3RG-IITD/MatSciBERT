Graphene-based nitrogen-doped carbon sandwich nanosheets: a new capacitive process controlled anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from graphite via a modified Hummers method32,33 and was dispersed into water by ultrasonication (1 mg mL-1, ~300 min). 25 mL of the above GO suspension was further dispersed into 175 mL of H2O by ultrasonication for 5 min. Then, the solution was put into a refrigerator and cooled down to 0-5 degC, which was followed by the addition of pyrrole (Sigma-Aldrich 1 mL). After vigorous stirring for 5 min, the oxidizer ((NH4)2S2O8 1.2 g/10 mL) was added to initiate the polymerization reaction of pyrrole which continued for 120 min under stirring. After that, the suspension was concentrated to approximately 30 mL by filtration, which was further dried by vacuum freeze-drying. Then, the as-prepared product (Go-Ppy) was pyrolysed at 500 degC, 700 degC, and 900 degC for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere, yielding the final products (designated as G-NCs-5, G-NCs, and G-NCs-9). Graphene (G) and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) were prepared via the same process only without the addition of pyrrole and graphene, respectively.
