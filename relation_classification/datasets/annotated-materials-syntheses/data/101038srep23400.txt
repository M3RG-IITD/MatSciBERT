Structural manipulation and tailoring of dielectric properties in SrTi1-xFexTaxO3 perovskites: Design of new lead free relaxors

Nominal compositions with stoichiometry SrTi1-2xFexTaxO3 (0.0 <= x <= 0.5) were prepared by solid state reaction of appropriate amounts of SrCO3, Fe2O3, Ta2O5 and TiO2. Homogenous mixtures of reactants were heated at 1173 K for 30 h in static air followed by regrinding and heating at 1473 K for 30 h in pellet form. The products were reground and pressed into pellets (10 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness) and sintered at 1623 K for 30 h.
