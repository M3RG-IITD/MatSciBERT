MnO2 nanoflakes/hierarchical porous carbon nanocomposites for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes
The overall synthetic procedure of the MnO2 nanoflakes/HPCs composites was outlined in Fig. 1. Hollow mesoporous silica spheres were used as template and phenolic resin was employed as carbon source. The uncalcined hollow mesoporous silica spheres were synthesized according to a previous report [26]. Briefly, 0.1 g of the hollow mesoporous silica was impregnated with 0.5 g of 20 wt% ethanol solution of phenolic resin and stirred for 24 h to form a uniform mixture. Then the mixture was evaporated at room temperature for 5 h, followed by heating in an oven at 100 degC for 24 h. The obtained yellow powder was carbonized at 800 degC for 4 h in argon atmosphere. Finally, the resulting samples were washed with deionized water and ethanol and dried at 60 degC in a vacuum oven for 24 h to obtain SiO2/C composite.

After that, 0.1 g of SiO2/C composite and 0.1 g of P123 (Aldrich, EO20PO70EO20) were ultrasonically dispersed in 30 mL deionized water in a 100 mL flask. 1 mL of 0.05 M KMnO4 aqueous solution was added and after stirring for 10 min in an ice bath, then 10.17 M Mn(NO3)2 solution with different volume (42, 200 and 576 uL, respectively) were mixed into the above suspension, and correspondingly, 0.05 M KMnO4 solution with various volume (3, 14 and 40 mL) was added dropwise. The precipitates were collected by filtration and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for several times. The silica template was removed by 2 M NaOH solution at 40 degC for 24 h, and then the samples were washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by drying at 60 degC for 12 h. The content of MnO2 in the three MnO2/HPCs composites was estimated to be 40%, 75% and 90% by TG test, respectively. And the composites were then denoted as MnO2/HPCs-40, MnO2/HPCs-75, MnO2/HPCs-90, respectively.
