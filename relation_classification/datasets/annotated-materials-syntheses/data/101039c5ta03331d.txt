Mechanical properties of organic-inorganic halide perovskites, CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br and Cl), by nanoindentation

Single crystals of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br and Cl) were prepared by precipitation from hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acid solutions after the method of Poglitsch et al.25 In this procedure, 2.5 g lead(II) acetate (Chemical Reagents, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 10 ml of concentrated aqueous HCl (37 wt%)/HBr (48 wt%)/HI (57 wt%) and heated to above 90 degC. To this solution, 2 ml of concentrated HX (X = Cl, Br and I) was added together with 0.597 g of CH3NH2 (40 wt% aqueous solution, Merck). Crystals about 2 mm in dimension were obtained by cooling the solutions from ~90 degC to 25 degC over 72 hours. The products were colourless for the chloride, orange for the bromide and black for the iodide (Fig. 1). For CH3NH3PbI3, the crystals were separated at above 40 degC to avoid the formation of yellow crystalline (CH3NH3)4PbI6*2H2O.26
