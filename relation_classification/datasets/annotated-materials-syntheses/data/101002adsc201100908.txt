Ionic Liquid-Promoted Oxidant-Free Dehydrogenation of Alcohols with Water-Soluble Ruthenium Nanoparticles in Aqueous Phase
To the aqueous solution of RuCl3 (0.038 M, 5 mL) were added 2.0 g (0.05 mmol) of PVP. The mixture was further stirred for 30 min under a bath of 0 degC. Then, an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (0.1 M, 19.0 mL) was rapidly added into the mixture under vigorous stirring. The color of the reaction mixture immediately turned from red-brown to black, indicating the formation of Ru nanoparticles. The hydrosol of the Ru nanoparticles was dialyzed overnight to remove inorganic impurities such as Na+ and Cl- by using a cellulose ester dialysis membrane with a cut-off molecular-weight of 10 kDa. The hydrosol of the Ru nanoparticles thus dialyzed was diluted to 30 mL. The pH value of the solution was measured to be 7.
The reaction was carried out in a reaction vessel equipped with a reflux condenser and connected to a bubbler. The vessel was evacuated and filled with N2, then, 3 mL of Ru nanoparticles aqueous solution (0.2 g PVP, 0.019 mmol Ru in 3 mL H2O) were placed in the reaction vessel, followed by addition of alcohol (0.48 mmol) and additive (1 mmol), and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred under reflux conditions under an N2 atmosphere for 24 h. After reaction, the mixture was extracted with ethyl ether three times. The conversion and selectivity were determined by GC analysis with biphenyl as an internal standard.
