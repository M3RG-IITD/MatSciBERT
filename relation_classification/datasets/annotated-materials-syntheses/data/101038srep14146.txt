Membranes of MnO Beading in Carbon Nanofibers as Flexible Anodes for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Mw = 80000) was made in laboratory52. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4, AR), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, AR) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, AR) were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Manganese sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4*H2O, AR) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All these reagents were used without further purification.
MnO2 NWs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Briefly, aqueous solutions of MnSO4*H2O (1 mmol) and KMnO4, (1.5 mmol) (Mn(II)/Mn(VII) = 3:2) were mixed with vigorously stirring. The PH value of the mixture was adjusted ~2 with 5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Then the solution was transferred to an autoclave and reacted in oven at 140 degC for 12 h. After cooling down, the product was collected by filtration and washed repeated with distilled water and absolute ethanol. Then the MnO2 NWs powder was obtained.
The obtained MnO2 NWs powder was washed three times with DMF, centrifuged and then added into a certain-mass 8 wt% PAN/DMF solution as an electrospinning solution. Intensive stirring was conducted for 12 h in order to get a homogeneously distributed solution. Then the blended solution was electrospun into MnP membranes, with a controlled syringe pump of 25 Î¼L min-1 and an applied voltage of 20 kV with a distance of 20 cm between the electrospinning jet and the collector. The adding amounts of MnO2 NWs based on PAN were 10 wt%, 20 wt% and 30 wt% for MnP-1, MnP-2 and MnP-3, respectively.
