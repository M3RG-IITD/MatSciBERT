Layered nickel metal-organic framework for high performance alkaline battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices

All reagents used were of analytical grade and used without any purification. In a typical process, NiCl2*6H2O (0.173 g) and p-benzenedicarboxylic acid (PTA) (0.332 g) were dissolved in 10 mL and 5 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), respectively under vigorous stirring for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the DMF solution of NiCl2*6H2O was slowly added to the ligand solution (PTA) drop by drop. After forming a greenish solution, the as-prepared mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL volume) and maintained at 120 degC for 16 h. After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature, the precipitate was washed via centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 min with DMF and alcohol several times followed by solvent exchange with methanol four times over two days. The samples were fully activated by removing solvent with vacuum at 100 degC over 12 h.
