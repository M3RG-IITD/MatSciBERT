Unusual CH4 dry reforming performance over Ni-based catalyst separated from nickel metal hydride battery waste
Ni-MH waste used here was collected from the crucible for producing Ni-MH battery provided from Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd., Japan. In our previous study, Ni-based compound was successfully separated from Ni-MH waste by a series of acid and base treatments [Environ. Sci. Technol., submitted]. Namely, Ni-MH waste of 10 g was dissolved with 2 M (mol/dm3) HCl solution of 200 ml for 24 h. Then, the dissolved transition and rare-earth metal ions were precipitated at pH 12 with 2 M NaOH solution. The Ni component was extracted from this precipitate by treating with 7.5 M NH3 aq. of 200 ml, through forming a Ni-ammonium complex. After filtration, the purple filtrate was heated around 60 degC to decompose the Ni-ammonium complex and to obtain Ni(OH)2. The sample, s-NiO, was obtained by calcination of the resulting Ni(OH)2 at 1000 degC.
