An electrochemical sensor for H2O2 based on a new Co-metal-organic framework modified electrode

A mixture of Co(AC)2*4H2O (0.25 mM, 62 mg), H2pbda (H2pbda = 3-(pyridine-3-yloxy)benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid) (0.25 mM, 78 mg), 4,4-bpy(0.25 mM, 48 mg) and KOH (0.05 mM, 28 mg) was added in 10 ml distilled water and stirred at room temperature for 30 min, then the resulting mixture was sealed in a 25 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 160 degC for 3 days. After the reactant was cooled slowly to room temperature with a cooling rate of 5 degC/h, purple block-shaped crystals were obtained in 60% yield (based on Co). Elemental anal. (%): Calcd. For [Co(pbda)(4,4-bpy)*2H2O]n: C 51.44, H 3.12, N 6.67. Found: C 50.13, H 3.32, N 6.78. Crystallographic parameters for (Co(pbda)(4,4-bpy)*2H2O)n: a = 21.9803(8) Å, b = 17.2195(7) Å, c = 9.2491(3) Å, α = 90.00deg, β = 105.929(2)deg, γ = 90.00deg, Mr = 841.48, monoclinic, space group C2/c, V = 3366.3(2) Å3, Z = 4, goodness-of-fit = 1.029, R1 = 0.0559 ([I > 2σ(I)]) and wR2 = 0.0965 (all data). Crystallographic data (CIF file) of [Co(pbda)(4,4-bpy)*2H2O]n have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre and CCDC deposition number is 1034563.
