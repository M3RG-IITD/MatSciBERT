The influence of oxygen on the microstructural, optical and photochromic properties of polymer-matrix, tungsten-oxide nanocomposite films
The matrix chosen was a commercially-available, 127 Î¼m thick, FEP film (CS Hyde, Lake Villa, IL). This material was placed in a glass reaction vessel with 300 mg of tungsten carbonyl precursor (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The reaction vessel was evacuated to 100 m Torr to remove air from the reaction chamber as well as to remove volatiles from the polymer matrix. While under vacuum, the entire system was placed in a furnace and heated to 150 degC to vaporize the precursor. The vessel was held at temperature for at least 3 hs to allow precursor diffusion into the polymer. Subsequent heating to 175 degC produced thermal decomposition of the precursor within the polymer and this temperature was held for approximately 4 h to permit particle formation and growth. The system was allowed to cool gradually to room temperature. This process resulted in a polymer film reinforced with discrete, tungsten-oxide nanoparticles distributed throughout the bulk of the material. Since the matrix is not degraded during particle synthesis, the process described can be performed repeatedly to coarsen existing particles and to nucleate new ones. For the work reported here, PMNCs are designated according to the number of processing cycles a given material experienced - 1x for one processing cycle, 2x for two cycles, etc. There are physical limits to the number of processing cycles that a material can undergo related to the precursor diffusion into the material, however the practical working limit relates primarily to the time required for synthesis. The maximum number of cycles used in the work presented here is four.
