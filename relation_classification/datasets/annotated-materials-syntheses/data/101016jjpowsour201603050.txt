Reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotubes sponge: A new high capacity and long life anode material for sodium-ion batteries
Graphene oxide (GO) was obtained from commercial graphite by a modified Hummers method, which has been reported in our previous work [28]. For the synthesis of rGO sponge (GS) and GCNTS, in a typical process, CNTs (Nanotech Port Co. Ltd, Shenzhen, China) aqueous dispersion was added into a vial containing GO aqueous dispersion. In this step, the weight ratio of GO to CNTs was changed by adjusting the volumes of GO solution and CNTs solution. The mixed solution was stirred under magnetic stirring, and then the vial was placed into a freezer. After the mixed solution was frozen, the vial was moved to a freeze-dryer (-53 degC, pressure < 10 Pa) for 3 days to obtain the GCNTS. Finally, GCNTS was calcined at 800 degC for 3 h in nitrogen atmosphere. GS was also prepared for comparison according to similar procedure without the use of CNTs.
