Structure and properties of MgMxCr2-xO4 (M = Li, Mg, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ga) spinels for electrode supports in solid oxide fuel cells
Samples containing Li, Mg, Fe and Cu were prepared by citric acid-nitrate combustion synthesis,34 while the samples containing Ti, Ga were prepared by solid state reaction. After the combustion reaction was complete, the obtained powders were calcined at 1000 degC for 10 hours. For solid state synthesis Cr2O3 (Alfa Aesar (99%)), (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2*5H2O (Aldrich (99%)), TiO2 (Alfa Aesar (99.5%)), Ga2O3 (Aldrich (99.99%)) were weighed in stoichiometric amounts and mixed using an ultrasonic probe in acetone for 10 minutes, in order to obtain a good dispersion of the oxides and homogenisation. A small amount (1 wt%) of dispersant KD-I (Tape Casting Warehouse, polyester/polyamide copolymer), was added and the dispersion was stirred for 2 hours. The mixtures were dried and the resulting powders were calcined at 1000 degC for 10 hours. After being calcined, the powders were milled for 2 hours in acetone and then dried. The resulting powders were then pressed into pellets (13 mm diameter and 2 +- 0.3 mm thickness) at a pressure of ~200 MPa and sintered at 1400 degC for 12 hours in air.
