Ni-P and Ni-Cu-P modified carbon catalysts for methanol electro-oxidation in KOH solution
Electroless deposition solution was chosen to be as simple as possible. It consists of 26.27 g L-1 nickel sulphate as a source of nickel, 38.71 g L-1 sodium citrate, 27.2 g L-1 sodium acetate as a source of complexing agent to control the rate of the release of the free metal ions in the reduction solution, 21 g L-1 glycine and 38.12 g L-1 sodium hypophosphite as a source of reducing agent, which also constitutes the source of phosphorus in the deposit. 0.015 g L-1 copper sulphate was added to deposition baths for Ni-Cu-P/C coatings. In addition to other constituents, sodium hydroxide was added as a buffering agent to control the bath pH. The effect of temperature (70-90 degC), pH (7-12) and the deposition time (30-90 min) was investigated to achieve the optimum conditions for the electroless deposition process. All chemicals used for the present work were of analytical reagent grade and the solutions were prepared using double distilled water.
