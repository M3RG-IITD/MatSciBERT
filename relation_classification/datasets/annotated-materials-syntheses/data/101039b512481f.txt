In situ synthesis and assembly of copper oxide nanocrystals on copper foil via a mild hydrothermal process
Cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), nonionic surfactant poly(oxyethylene) (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenyl ether (Tx-100), ammonium peroxydisulfate ((NH4)2S2O8, APS) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased commercially and used without further purification. Copper foils (1.5 x 1.5 cm, 99.9%) with a thickness of 0.2 mm were washed with 1 M NaOH, 1 M HCl and deionized water before use.
In a typical procedure, the starting solution was prepared by mixing 6.4 g NaOH (5 M) and 1.0954 g (NH4)2S2O8 (0.15 M) in 32 ml water. After 5 min, 0.2333 g CTAB (0.02 M) was introduced into the aqueous solution under stirring, resulting in a white aqueous solution. After CTAB had completely dissolved in the water, the solution was transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves, and the previously-cleaned copper foil was then immersed in the solution. After that, the autoclaves was sealed and maintained at 160 degC for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the copper foil was then taken out from the solution and rinsed with distilled water, and a sample of black film on the copper foil was obtained.
