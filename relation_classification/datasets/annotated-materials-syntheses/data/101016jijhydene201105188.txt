Effect of addition of rhenium to Pt-based anode catalysts in electro-oxidation of ethanol in direct ethanol PEM fuel cell

The precursors used for the preparation of electrocatalysts were H2PtCl6.6H2O (Alfa Aesar, USA), SnCl2.2H2O (Merck, Germany) and ReCl3 (Alfa Aesar, USA). Vulcan XC-72 (Carbot, USA) was used as support for the catalysts. Carbon paper (90T, Toray, USA) was used as substrate for the catalyst powder to prepare the electrodes. Nafion(r) (DE 521, DuPont, USA) dispersion was used to make the catalyst slurry. Ethanol (Merck, Germany) and H2SO4 (Merck, Germany) were used as fuel and as electrolyte for electrochemical analysis, respectively. Nafion 117(r) (DuPont, USA) proton exchange membrane was used to prepare membrane electrode assembly for DEFC. Pt/C (40%wt) (Johnson Matthey) was used as cathode catalyst.

The precursors were first suspended in propanol and then ultrasonicated for 3 h. High-surface-area carbon black, e.g., Vulcan XC-72, was preheated to 110 degC and suspended in propanol separately and ultrasonicated for 3 h. Precursor suspension is then added drop wise to carbon suspension [17]. The weight ratio of Pt-X/C (X = Sn, Re, Re-Sn) was controlled according to the targeted metal loading. Ultrasonic blending for 3 h, of precursor and carbon suspension was carried out to ensure the proper impregnation of metal precursors on carbon support. The suspension is then kept at 70 degC for 12 h and all the propanol is evaporated. The precursor mixtures were reduced in hydrogen atmosphere at different temperatures to obtain desired bimetallic and tri-metallic catalysts by impregnation method. Table 1 shows different catalysts and their loadings. Abbreviation used to show the metal composition in the catalyst, e.g., Pt-Re-Sn/C (20:5:15) represents 20% Pt, 5% Re, 15% Sn by wt and rest 60 %wt is carbon.
