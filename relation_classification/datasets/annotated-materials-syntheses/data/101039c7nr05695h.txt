Solution-processed indium oxide electron transporting layers for high-performance and photo-stable perovskite and organic solar cells
Indium nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)3*xH2O, 99.99%), indium acetylacetonate (In(AcAc)3, 99.99%), indium chloride (InCl3, 99.999%), P3HT (regioregular, 99%), PCBM (>99%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.95%), anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN, 99.8%), anhydrous ethanol (>99.5%), anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), anhydrous diethyl ether (99.9%), anhydrous toluene (99.8%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%), and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) was purchased from Clevios. PbI2 (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) (99.98%) was purchased from Dyesol. Poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA, Mn = 17500 g mol-1) was purchased from EM Index. The indium precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 M indium nitrate hydrate in anhydrous ethanol. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was prepared via the Lewis base adduct approach according to a previous report; 461 mg of PbI2, 159 mg of MAI, and 78 mg of DMSO were mixed with 600 mg of DMF.36,37 The P3HT/PCBM solution was prepared by dissolving 1 wt% P3HT and 1 wt% PCBM in 1 mL of CB at 60 degC for 30 min. A PTAA solution was prepared by dissolving 15 mg of PTAA in 1 mL of toluene. For Li-doping, 15 μL of Li-TFSi/ACN (170 mg of Li-TFSi in 1 mL of ACN) and 15 μL of tBP/ACN (1:1, v/v) were added to the PTAA solution. The PEDOT:PSS solution was modified by mixing 1 wt% Triton X-100. All the solutions were prepared in a N2-filled glove box.
