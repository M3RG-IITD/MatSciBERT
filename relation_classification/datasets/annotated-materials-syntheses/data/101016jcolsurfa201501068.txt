Mesoscopic architectures of Co(OH)2 spheres with an extended array of microporous threads as pseudocapacitor electrode materials

All the chemicals used in the present study were of analytical grade obtained from Nice Chemicals, India. Firstly, 1 M of Co(NO3)2 was completely dissolved in 32 mL of methanol under constant stirring condition. To this solution, 1 M of ammonia solution was added followed by 32 mL addition of water. This solution was stirred for 30 min. The obtained precipitate solution was autoclaved in a teflon lined container at 90 degC for different time intervals ranging from 3 to 24 h. The resultant solution was centrifuged and filtered for 30 min. The obtained precipitate was thoroughly washed with de-ionized water and oven dried for 12 h in air at 50 degC. Based on the processing time the powders were designated as C-3, C-6, C-12 and C-24 where C and number represent cobalt hydroxide and time, respectively.
