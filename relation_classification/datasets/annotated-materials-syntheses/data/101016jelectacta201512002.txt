Biomass derived hierarchical porous carbons as high-performance anodes for sodium-ion batteries
Hierarchical porous carbons were prepared by carbonization and activation of peanut skin with and without hydrothermal pretreatment. The employed peanut skins were peeled off from peanuts grown in the Shandong region of China. Route one: 2.0 g of peanut skin and 50 mL of diluted sulfuric acid were placed in a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 180 degC for 24 h and then cooled down naturally. The resulting biochar was collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried. The activation agent (KOH) and dried biochar, in a mass ratio of 1:1 or 2:1, were thoroughly ground in an agate mortar, and then the mixture was heated at 800 degC with a heating rate of 5 degC min-1 for 1 h under argon flow. After that, the activated samples were thoroughly washed with 2 M HCl and distilled water, and finally dried in an oven at 100 degC for 12 h. The obtained carbons were denoted as HPC-1-n, where n represents the KOH to biochar mass ratio. Route two: 1.0 g of peanut skin was impregnated in 50 mL KOH solution (2 M or 4 M) for 2 days. After that, the peanut skin-KOH mixture was collected by filtration and drying. Activation was also carried out in a tubular furnace at 800 degC (5 degC min-1) for 1 h under argon flow. The activated sample was also thoroughly washed with 2 M HCl and distilled water, and finally dried in an oven at 100 degC for 12 h. The resultant carbon was labeled as HPC-2-m, where m represents the concentration of KOH solution.
