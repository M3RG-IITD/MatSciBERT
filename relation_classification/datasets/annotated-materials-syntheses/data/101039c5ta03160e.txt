3D flower-like NaHTi 3 O 7 nanotubes as high-performance anodes for sodium-ion batteries
NaHTi3O7 nanotubes were synthesized at a low temperature through a hydrothermal method. Initially, 1.4 g TiO2 powder (anatase) was dispersed in a 70 mL 15 M NaOH aqueous solution in a sealed Teflon vessel. After being stirred for 5 h, the solution mixture was heated at 130 degC for 72 h in an oven, and was subsequently cooled to room temperature in air. The obtained preliminary precipitate was washed with deionized water until a pH value of 7 was reached. After alcohol-cleaning, the precipitate was collected by using a centrifuge and then the mixture was dried in an oven at 60 degC for 12 h; the precursor (NaHTi3O7*2H2O) was obtained. Finally, the precursor was heated in a muffle furnace at 600 degC and incubated for 2 hours to release the crystal water, and then the as-prepared NaHTi3O7 nanotubes were obtained.
