NaV3(PO4)3/C nanocomposite as novel anode material for Na-ion batteries with high stability

NaV3(PO4)3/C was synthesized by a sol-gel process and followed by carbon thermal reduction synthesis. Typically, 6 mmol NH4VO3 were added to 70 mL deionized water maintaining at 80 degC with continuous stirring to obtain a clear yellow solution, and then 6 mmol NH4H2PO4, 2 mmol Na2CO3 and 4 mmol citric acid were added. Continuous stirring, the colour of the solution transformed to blue. After evaporation of water at 80 degC, the solution transforms from sol to gel. The gel was dried in an oven at 150 degC for 4 h, and heat-treated at 400 degC for 5 h under nitrogen atmosphere to remove CO2, H2O, and NH3. Afterward, the powder was grounded and annealed at 900 degC under H2/Ar flow (10% H2) for 12 h to produce the final compound. Herein, citric acid was used as complexing agent and carbon source. For comparison, NaV3(PO4)3 without carbon source was synthesized with the same process above. For preparing NASICON-typed Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode material, the same synthesis approach was adapted only changing the stoichiometric amount of precursor of NH4VO3, NH4H2PO4 and Na2CO3.
