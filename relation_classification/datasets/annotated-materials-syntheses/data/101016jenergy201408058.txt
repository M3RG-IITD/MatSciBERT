Hierarchical 3D micro-/nano-V2O5 (vanadium pentoxide) spheres as cathode materials for high-energy and high-power lithium ion-batteries

Hierarchical 3D micro-/nano-V2O5 spheres were prepared via a facile low temperature hydrothermal method. Typically, NH4VO3 (ammonium metavanadate) solution, HCl, and poly (sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, 2 mL) were well mixed in DI (deionized) water. The pH of the mixed solution was adjusted to be less than 2.7 so as to assist the growth of V2O5[58]. The resultant solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 180 degC for 24 h in an electrical oven. After cooling down naturally to room temperature, the precipitates were washed with DI water and ethanol alternatively for several times to remove residual starting materials before further characterization and electrochemical testing. As a reference, spherical V2O5 particles was also prepared by a PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone)-assisted hydrolysis method [59].
