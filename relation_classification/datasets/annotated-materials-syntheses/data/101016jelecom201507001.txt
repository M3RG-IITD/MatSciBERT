Intrinsic electrochemical performance and precise control of surface porosity of graphene-modified electrodes using the drop-casting technique

Graphite and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and are of reagent grade or higher. In the production of graphene, the first step was the oxidation of graphite to graphite oxide using the modified-Hummers method as reported in the literature [24] and [25]. The graphite oxide was subsequently thermally exfoliated at 1000 degC to give reduced graphene based on our previous method [26]. Glassy carbon (GC) electrodes (CH Instruments, USA) of 3 mm diameter were used as the working electrode, and a platinum electrode as the auxiliary electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode (1 M KCl) was used as the reference. Graphene dispersions were prepared in DMF at concentrations ranging from 1.0 mg mL- 1 to 7.0 mg mL- 1, by ultrasonication for an initial 10 mins followed by 5 mins before each subsequent drop-casting event. Deionised water with a resistivity of 18.2 MÎ© cm was used throughout for preparation of solutions. Scanning electron microscopy was performed with a JSM-7600F field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) in gentle-beam mode at 2 kV. Graphene was drop-casted onto silicon wafers (Graphene Supermarket, USA) for imaging under conditions detailed in Section 3.2.
