Precipitation behavior of perovskite and anosovite crystals from high Ti-bearing blast furnace slag with small amount of B2O3
CaO was obtained by calcining CaCO3 at 900 degC for 8 hours. The compositions of the synthetic slag (seeing Table 2) in the present study were selected based on the blast furnace slag compositions of pan-steel. These chemicals were weighed according to Table 2 and mixed using an agate mortar and pestle for 20 min. The mixtures were then pelletized. Each pellet (approximate 0.2 g) was placed in a high-purity graphite crucible (purity 99.9%, 10 mm inner diameter and 10 mm inner height, Mathews Industrial Products Pty Ltd, Australia).
