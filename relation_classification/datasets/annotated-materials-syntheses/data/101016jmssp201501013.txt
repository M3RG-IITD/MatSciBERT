Enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of strontium-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles

To begin the synthesis of Sr-doped ZnO-NPs, analytical grade zinc nitrate hexahydrate Zn(NO3)2*6H2O, strontium nitrate Sr(NO3)2, gelatin (type B from bovine skin), and distilled water were used as starting materials. All of the materials used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The precursors were taken in the stoichiometric amounts of Zn1-xSrxO (x=0, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06) to obtain final products. First, a gelatin solution was prepared by adding gelatin (3.65 g) to distilled water at 60 degC. The metal nitrates were dissolved separately in a minimal amount of distilled water at room temperature, and then these were added to the gelatin solution. After that, the compound solutions were stirred and heated at 80 degC until gels were obtained. The gels were calcined at 550 degC for 5 h, at a heating rate of 2 degC/min. The resulting powders were characterized using several tools to check their quality.
