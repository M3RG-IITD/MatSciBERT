High-Performance Oxygen-Permeable Membranes with an Asymmetric Structure Using Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-Î´ Perovskite-Type Oxide
A porous BLF support was fabricated by an oxalate method 28. Ba (9.5 mmol) and La (0.5 mmol) acetates and Fe nitrate (10 mmol) were first dissolved in water (100 mL). The mixed metal salt solution was then added to ethanol (100 mL) containing oxalic acid (90 mmol). The mixing produced a yellow-colored suspension, which was allowed to stand for 1 h. The use of ethanol was critical to the precipitation of the metal oxalates. The suspension was filtrated to collect the precursor metal oxalate particles. The obtained precursor powder was dried at 120 degC for 2 h and then calcined at 700 degC for 2 h. The calcined powder was press-formed into a disk to form a green porous support disk. A BLF powder as the precursor of a dense layer was prepared by an AMP method 31. An aqueous malic acid solution (50 mL) was added to a solution (50 mL) containing the corresponding metal nitrates or acetates in a stoichiometric ratio under vigorous stirring. The molar ratio of malic acid to total metal ions was set to 1.5. The pH of the mixed aqueous solution was adjusted to 6 with aqueous ammonia (28%). The mixed solution was evaporated to dryness and the obtained powder was calcined in air at 800 degC. The calcined powder was ground and dispersed in ethanol to prepare a precursor slurry (10 wt %) for fabricating a dense layer on a porous support. A dense BLF layer was formed by dropping the slurry (0.6 mL) on the green porous support. The support disk was dried at room temperature and sintered at 1175 degC for 5 h to fabricate an asymmetric BLF membrane. For comparison, sintered-disk-type BLF membranes were also fabricated using the BLF powder prepared by the AMP method. The thickness of the sintered-disk membranes was controlled to about 1.0 and 0.5 mm by polishing the surfaces with emery paper (# 80). The morphology of the surface and cross-sections of the asymmetric membrane were observed with a SEM (JSM-6340F, JEOL Co., LTD.). The oxygen permeation flux through the fabricated asymmetric membrane was measured using the apparatus used in the previous study 18. The dense layer side of the asymmetric membrane was fixed on a quartz tube using a silver ring as an adhesive agent at 960-970 degC. Air (O2/N2 mixture gases) and He were supplied to the porous support side and dense layer side, respectively. The flow rates of air (O2/N2 mixture gases) and He were 200 and 150 mL min-1, respectively. The concentration of permeated oxygen from the air side to the He side was detected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) of a gas chromatograph directly connected to the effluent line of the dense layer side.
