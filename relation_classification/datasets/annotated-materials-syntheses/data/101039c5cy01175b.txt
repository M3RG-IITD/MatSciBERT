In situ spectroscopic investigations of MoOx/Fe2O3 catalysts for the selective oxidation of methanol
MoOx/Fe2O3 was prepared using the incipient wetness technique. Commercial Fe2O3 (Sigma Aldrich, <50 nm) was first calcined at 500 degC for 3 hours, before adding the desired amount of aqueous ammonium heptamolybdate for 1, 3 or 6 monolayers (MLS) MoOx/Fe2O3. The samples were dried at 120 degC for 24 hours, before being calcined at 500 degC for 24 hours in a muffle furnace. For subsequent reduction studies, the calcined materials were reduced in a tube furnace under a methanol/He flow at 350 degC for three hours. Bulk phase samples were synthesised to be used as reference standards in the analysis. Stoichiometric Fe(NO3)3*9H2O (Fe(III), Sigma Aldrich >98%) was added drop wise to a stirring solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24*4H2O (Fluka Analytical, >99%) previously acidified to pH 2 with dilute HNO3. The resulting mixture was heated to 90 degC for ~1 hour until a yellow sludge remained. This was left to air dry overnight, after which it was dried at 120 degC for 24 hours, followed by calcination at 500 degC for 48 hours.
