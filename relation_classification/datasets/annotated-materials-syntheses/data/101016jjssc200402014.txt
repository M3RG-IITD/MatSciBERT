Synthesis and characterization of n=5, 6 members of the La4Srn-4TinO3n+2 series with layered structure based upon perovskite
The samples were prepared by traditional solid-state reaction. Stoichiometric amounts of pre-dried high-purity La2O3, SrCO3 and TiO2 (Aldrich) were mixed and ground and then calcined at 1200degC for 6 h. The resulting powder was subsequently ground, mixed and uniaxially pressed into pellets, which were deposited on alumina crucibles containing sacrificial powder and then they were fired at 1400-1600degC for 3-9 days with intermediate processes of grinding, mixing and "pelletizing". XRD data were collected with a Stoe StadiP X-ray diffractometer, using CuKα1 radiation in the range 2θ=5-70deg in steps of 0.1deg at 300 s/step. HRTEM imaging and SAED were carried out using a JEOL-JEM 2011 electron microscope operating at 200 kV and equipped with a side entry +-20deg double tilt specimen holder. EDS microanalyses were performed using an Oxford Link ISIS system in at least 25 different crystals to confirm compositional homogeneity.
