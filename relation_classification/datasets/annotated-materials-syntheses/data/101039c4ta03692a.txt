Understanding the stepwise capacity increase of high energy low-Co Li-rich cathode materials for lithium ion batteries
All the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich Sigma. The Li[CoxLi1/3-x/3Mn2/3-2x/3]O2 (x = 0, 0.087, 0.1, 0.118) composites were synthesized in two steps. First, stoichiometric amounts of Mn(NO3)2*4H2O and Co(NO3)2*6H2O were dissolved in distilled water and then slowly added dropwise to an equal volume of 0.2 M sodium carbonate solution under vigorous stirring. After 20 h aging at room temperature, the metal ions were fully co-precipitated as carbonates. In the second step, the collected carbonates were pre-treated at 500 degC for 5 h in air and then calcined with a stoichiometric amount of LiOH*H2O at 900 degC for another 12 h in air to produce the final cathode materials. A 3 wt% excess of LiOH*H2O was applied to the calcination process to compensate for Li volatilization at elevated temperature.
