Photoinduced electron transfer in pentacoordinated complex of zinc tetraphenylporphyrin and isoquinoline N-oxide. Crystal structure, spectroscopy and DFT studies
Tetraphenylporphine (TPP) was prepared from pyrrole and benzaldehyde in boiling propionic acid [22]. Pyrrole was obtained by the known method [23] using the thermal decomposition of diammonium salt of mucic acid which was prepared from mucic acid and NH4OH. Mucic acid was synthesized by galactose oxidation with HNO3 upon heating [24].
Zn-tetraphenylporphine (Zn-TPP) was synthesized according to known procedure [25] with some changes. Tetraphenylporphine (TPP) in CHCl3 was kept over PbO2 during 2 days to remove admixture of tetraphenylchlorine (2-10% of which can be formed at TPP synthesis) and a radical of unknown structure [26]. A mixture of 0.5 g (0.813 mmol) TPP, 0.25 g (1.14 mmol, 1.4-fold excess) of (CH3COO)2Zn*2H2O, 50 mL of chloroform and 250 mL of glacial acetic acid was boiled for 1 h (using of 7-fold excess of (CH3COO)2Zn leads to the final substance almost without the initial TPP). The resultant dark blue crystals of Zn-TPP were washed with acetic acid. Then the substance was chromatographed on an alumina column with chloroform. TLC was used (Silufol, chloroform-hexane 2:1) for Zn-TPP purity determination. Yield 0.43 g (77%).
To 34 mg (0.05 mM) of Zn-TPP dissolved in 15 mL of acetone, 1 mL of an acetone solution of isoquinoline N-oxide (7.3 mg, 0.05 mM) was added. The red-violet crystals appeared in 30 min, which were washed with acetone (1 mL, 2 times) and air dried. Yield 70% (29 mg).
