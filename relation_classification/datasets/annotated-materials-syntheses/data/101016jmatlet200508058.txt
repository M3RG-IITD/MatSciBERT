Self-assembly of mono-crystalline NdF3 nanostructures during hydrothermal process
The NdF3 samples were obtained through a simple hydrothermal process. In a typical synthesis procedure, 3 ml of 1M NH4F was added to 10 ml of 0.1 M Nd(NO3)3 solution. The mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with 20 mL capacity. The sealed tank was heated in an oven to 160 degC and maintained there for 10 h, then taken out and cooled down to room temperature under ambiance condition. After the reactions, the composite samples were washed with de-ionized water and pure ethanol, respectively for several times and dried in vacuum at room temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded by RIGAKU-DMAX2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at a scanning rate of 5deg/min for 2θ ranging from 5deg to 85deg. The microstucture, morphology, and chemical composition of the samples were examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
