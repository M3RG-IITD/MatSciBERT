Low-temperature CO oxidation on CuO/CeO 2 catalysts: the significant effect of copper precursor and calcination temperature

All chemicals were of analytical grade from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China) and used without further purification. CuO/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a commercial CeO2 support (SBET = 11.1 m2 g-1) with an aqueous solution of Cu(CH3COO)2, Cu(NO3)2, CuCl2, or CuSO4 to obtain a Cu loading of 10 wt.%. The CeO2 support was pre-treated at 120 degC for 4 h before use to remove the impurity adsorbed on the surface. After being impregnated quiescently at room temperature (RT) for 24 h, the sample was dried at 90 degC for 24 h, followed by calcination in static air at 500 or 800 degC for 4 h. For comparison, CuO was prepared by thermal decomposition of Cu(NO3)2 at 500 degC for 4 h. The prepared catalysts were denoted as CuO/CeO2(X)-Y, where X and Y refer to precursor (A for acetate, N for nitrate, C for chloride, and S for sulfate) and calcination temperature (500 or 800 degC), respectively.
