Enhancing phase stability and kinetics of lithium-rich layered oxide for an ultra-high performing cathode in Li-ion batteries
We synthesized LLO doped with F, which exhibited enhancing phase stability and Li ion kinetics by our computational investigation, and measured its electrochemical performance. F-doped LLO formulated as Li1.17Ni0.17Co0.17Mn0.50O2-zFz (0 <= z <= 0.1) was prepared as follows: the starting materials of the precursor Ni0.2Co0.2Mn0.6(OH)2 were prepared from a 2:2:6 molar ratio of Ni/Co/Mn sulfate-containing solution using a co-precipitation reactor. The precipitate was continuously rotated at 600 rpm at 50 degC, and the pH was maintained at 11.5 by controlling the concentration of NH4OH. The product was repeatedly rinsed with de-ionized water, filtered and dried overnight. Li2CO3, LiF, and the precursor powder corresponding to the desired stoichiometry were mixed and thoroughly grounded. The resulting mixtures were pelletized and calcined at 700 degC in a stream of dried air for 10 h.
