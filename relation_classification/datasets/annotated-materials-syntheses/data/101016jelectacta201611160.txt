A simple method to synthesize V 2 O 5 nanostructures with controllable morphology for high performance Li-ion batteries
V2O5 nanomaterials were synthesized using solid-state chemical reaction methods. All the reagents were analytically pure from commercial sources and used without further purification. Typical synthesis for V2O5 nanostructures was as follows. Solid ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, AR, >99%) and tartaric acid (C4H6O6, AR, >99%) with a molar ratio of 1:2, and polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG-4000, AR, >99%) were apart weighed and ground in an agate mortar for about 5 min to ensure the evenness of starting materials, then mixed. Then the reactants were mixed, and the color of mixture changed from white to yellow. After grind for 30 min at room temperature, the color of mixture changed from yellow to grey. The obtained sample was washed with absolute ethanol, and then dried at 60 degC for 10 h. Finally pure grey precursor (NH4)2[(VO)(C4H4O6)2] was got. Then the precursor was placed in muffle furnace at different calcination temperature of 400 degC, 500 degC, 600 degC for 4 h (1 degC min-1) to obtain final products.
