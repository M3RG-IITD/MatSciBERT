A novel hydrogen peroxide sensor based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes/poly(pyrocatechol violet)-modified glassy carbon electrode
MWCNTs (95% purity) were purchased from Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry of Academy of Sciences and synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. PCV was obtained from the Jiangsu Chemical Company (China). H2O2 and other chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent (Shanghai, China) used without further purification. Voltammetric experiments were carried out in solutions deaerated by pure nitrogen. The phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.1M) was prepared by 0.1M KH2PO4 and 0.1M K2HPO4, and then adjusted the pH with 0.1M H3PO4 and 0.1M KOH solutions. All the solutions were prepared with doubly distilled water, and all experiments were conducted at the room temperature.
