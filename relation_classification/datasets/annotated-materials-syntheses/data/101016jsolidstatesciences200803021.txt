All reagents were of analytical grade and were used as obtained from commercial sources without further purification. Mn[P2O5(OH)2] can be synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. Typically, we charged 4 mmol Mn(CH3COO)2*4H2O (or MnCl2*4H2O) into a 50 ml Teflon reactor, then added 3 ml concentrated H3PO4 and sealed the reactor into a stainless steel container. After they were heated at 200 degC for 5 days, the solid products were cooled to room temperature and washed with hot water (80 degC). The obtained Mn[P2O5(OH)2] products are colorless and tablet crystals. Sometimes, a known phase, MnP2O7, is presented as a by-product. The purity of the title compound can be testified by the powder X-ray diffraction.
