Effects of highly crumpled graphene nanosheets on the electrochemical performances of pseudocapacitor electrode materials

The nickel foam was purchased from Shanghai Zhongwei New Material Co., Ltd. The pore size of the nickel foam ranges from 0.1 mm to 10 mm and its volume density is 0.1 to 0.8 g cm-3. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. GS was made via a modified Hummers method followed by a thermal exfoliation (at 800 degC for 1 min under a H2/Ar atmosphere with 10 degC/min heating rate). In a typical synthesis process, 5 mg GS and 0.3 g NiCl2*6H2O were dispersed in 20 ml distilled water and subjected to ultrasonic vibration to form a homogeneous suspension, respectively. The two former suspensions were homogeneously mixed with each other and subjected to ultrasonic vibration for a while, and then freeze drying (named as M1). The 1.03 g NaH2PO2*H2O was grinded in a mortar and mixed with M1. Then, the mixture was calcined at 500 degC for 1 h with 2 degC/min heating rate and cooled to room temperature under a flow of Ar (99.999%). The solid obtained was washed thoroughly with distilled water and absolute ethyl alcohol to remove the by-products. After that, the wet products were dried at 80 degC for 12 h in a vacuum oven.
