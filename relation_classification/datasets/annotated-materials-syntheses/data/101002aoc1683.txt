Palladium-Schiff base-triphenylphosphine catalyzed oxidation of alcohols
All the chemicals used were of analytical grade. Solvents were purified and dried according to standard procedures.21 Anhydrous PdCl2 was purchased from Merck and was used without further purification. [PdCl2 (PPh3)2] was prepared by the reaction of anhydrous PdCl2 (CDH) and triphenylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran (Merck) under reflux for 5 h.22 The Schiff bases were prepared in 70-80% yield by condensation reactions of 2-hydrazinopyridine (Aldrich) with the corresponding 5-substituted salicylaldehyde (Loba) in methanolic media.23
Complexes PdL1-PdL5 were prepared by stirring a mixture of [PdCl2 (PPh3)2] in 3 ml of 0.1 M sodium acetate and the respective ligands in 15 ml alcohol in a 1:1 ratio for 5 h. The red solid was filtered off, washed with ethanol and dried in vacuo.
