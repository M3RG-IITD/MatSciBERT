Synthesis and characterization of NiV3O8 powder as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries
In this work, all the chemical reagents mentioned are of analytical grade and used without further purification.VO2 (B) precursor was firstly prepared by a hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis, commercial V2O5 powder (0.015 mol), oxalic acid (0.015 mol) and distilled water (65 mL) were mixed under vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature and kept for 2 h, and then the resultant mixture was transferred into an 80 mL stainless autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 180 degC for 30 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The product was collected and washed by distilled water and absolute ethanol for several times. The produced VO2 precursor was dried at 80 degC in vacuum for 12 h. After that, NiO, V2O5 and VO2 in stoichiometric amounts (1:1:1 in molar ratio) were mixed and wet milled in a planetary-type ball mill for 3 h under the protection of nitrogen. The milling speed was set at 200 rpm. Then the mixture was collected and dried in vacuum at 80 degC for 10 h. The mixture, after grinding, was heated up to 600 degC for 30 h under Ar flux, and then cooled down with the furnace to the room temperature.
