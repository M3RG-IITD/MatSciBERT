Hollow zeolite encapsulated Ni-Pt bimetals for sintering and coking resistant dry reforming of methane
Silicalite-1 (S-1) was synthesized by the clear solution method. Typically, 15.4 ml of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was mixed with a certain amount of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) solution. The molar composition of the synthesis mixture was 1 TEOS:0.27 TPAOH:37H2O. After being stirred for 3 h at 35 degC, the solution was heated at 80 degC to remove the ethanol generated during the hydrolysis of TEOS and then water was added to maintain constant volume. After crystallization at 170 degC for 3 days, the product was recovered by centrifugation and dried overnight at 100 degC. Finally, the template was removed by calcination in static air at 540 degC for 6 h.
2.2 Preparation of Ni@Hol S-1, Pt@Hol S-1 and Ni-Pt@Hol S-1
NiO/S-1 was synthesized by an incipient-wetness impregnation method. In brief, the calcined silicalite-1 was impregnated with an aqueous solution of NiCl2; after drying overnight at 100 degC, the product was calcined in static air at 400 degC for 2 h. The ideal Ni loadings on NiO/S-1 were 1.5, 3 and 5 wt%, respectively. The resulting samples are denoted as 1.5NiO/S-1, 3NiO/S-1 and 5NiO/S-1, respectively.
