Uniform iron oxide hollow spheres for high-performance delivery of insoluble anticancer drugs
Ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3*6H2O), anhydrous sodium acetate (NaOAc), polyethylene glycolethylene (PEG-2000), glycol (EG), ethanolamine (ETA), and ethanol were purchased from Beijing Chemicals. Camptothecin (CPT) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent. All chemical agents used in these experiments were of analytical grade and used directly without further purification.
The monodisperse Fe3O4 hollow spheres were synthesized using a one-pot solvothermal method. In detail, 1.5 g of FeCl3*6H2O was dissolved in 40 mL of solvent containing EG (30 mL) and ETA (10 mL) to form a stable orange solution. 4.0 g of NaAc and 1.0 g PEG-2000 were added into the above solution under vigorously magnetic stirring until completely dissolved. The homogeneous solution obtained was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL), sealed and heated at 200 degC. After reacting for 8 h, the autoclave was cooled to ambient temperature naturally. The obtained magnetite particles were washed with ethanol and deionized water in order, and then dried under vacuum at 60 degC for 12 h. The solvent effect of ETA in the solvothermal process was investigated in detail with different amounts of EG and ETA.
