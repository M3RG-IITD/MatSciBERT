Extremely low thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric performance in liquid-like Cu2Se1-xSx polymorphic materials

Polycrystalline Cu2Se1-xSx (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) samples were synthesized by a combination of melting and long-term high-temperature annealing. High purity raw elements, Cu (shot, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar), Se (shot, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar), and S (shots, 99.9999%, Alfa Aesar) were combined in their stoichiometric ratios and placed in boron nitride crucibles, which were then sealed in fused silica tubes under vacuum. The temperature of the tubes was slowly (100 K h-1) raised to 1423 K and maintained at that temperature for 12 h, and then cooled down to 1073 K in 24 h. After annealing at 1073 K for 8 days, the tubes were furnace cooled to room temperature. Small single crystals were extracted from the polycrystalline ingot sample after the annealing process. Finally, the annealed ingots were crushed into powders and consolidated by spark plasma sintering (Sumitomo SPS-2040) at 873 K under a pressure of 65 MPa for 5 minutes. Electrically insulating and thermally conducting BN layers were sprayed onto the carbon foils and the inner sides of the graphite die before the SPS process in order to prohibit DC pulsed currents going through the powders.
