"Evolution of microstructure and magnetic properties during annealing of a Cu-doped Fe75.3C7.0Si3.3B5.0P8.7Cu0.7 metallic glass were investigated via atom probe tomography. Cu segregation, which contains a rapid nucleation stage and a sluggish growth stage, was found to precede and may trigger the segregation of other elements and promote the following nanocrystallization. The nano-sized Î±-Fe precipitates have a composition close to that of the grain-orientated high-silicon steel, giving rise to the enhancement in the magnetization.",0
"We present here a thermal neutron diffraction study of Ho2In, in order to determine the magnetic structures in the two ordered magnetic phases, observed by magnetic susceptibility measurements (two magnetic transitions at T 1 â80 K and T 2â20K). A ferromagnetic structure is obtained below 80K, with identical magnetic moments for the Ho3+ ions, located on the (2a) and (2d) crystallographic sites in the P63/mmc space group. These magnetic moments are directed along the c hexagonal axis at high temperature (40<T<80K), then rotate towards the basal plane at lower temperature.",0
"Tensile and low cyclic fatigue tests were used to assess the influence of micro-additions of Ti/V/Zr on the performance of Alâ7Siâ1Cuâ0.5Mg (wt.%) alloys in the as-cast and T6 heat-treated conditions and their improvement was compared to the base alloy. The microstructure of the as-cast Alâ7Siâ1Cuâ0.5Mg (wt.%) base and modified alloys consisted of Î±-Al, eutectic Si, and Cu, the Mg- and Fe-based phases Al2.1Cu, Al8.5Si2.4Cu, Al7.2Si8.3Cu2Mg6.9 and Al14Si7.1FeMg3.3. In addition, the micro-sized Ti/V/Zr-rich phases Al6.8Si1.4Ti, Al21.4Si4.1Ti3.5VZr3.9, Al6.7Si1.2TiZr1.8, Al2.8Si3.8V1.6Zr and Al5.1Si35.4Ti1.6Zr5.7Fe were identified in the modified alloys. It was also noticed that increasing the content of TiâVâZr changed the morphology of Ti/V/Zr-rich phase. The tensile test results showed that the T6 heat-treated alloy modified with the addition of a higher content of TiâVâZr achieved the highest tensile strength of 343MPa over the base alloy and alloys modified with additions of Ti, TiâZr and lower contents of TiâVâZr. The plastic strain energy density coefficient of the alloy modified with the addition of a higher content of TiâVâZr in the T6 temper condition was higher than the other studied alloys and reached 162MJmâ3. The fatigue life of the same alloy was considerably longer than that of the other studied alloys, including the base alloy. The fractography revealed that all the studied alloys showed similar fracture behavior. The tensile cracks propagated through the eutectic Si and primary phases, exhibiting intergranular fracture along with some cleavage-like features of the plate-shaped ZrâTiâV-rich intermetallics with the presence of fatigue striations on the latter, indicating their ductile nature. It is believed that the morphological changes of intermetallic precipitates containing Zr, Ti and V enhance the fatigue life of the alloy modified with additions of larger amounts of TiâVâZr in the T6 condition.",0
"The magnetic properties of Sr nLaCuRuO n+5 (n = 1, 2, 3) have been investigated by dc susceptibility measurements in the temperature range 6 K â¤Tâ¤300 K. SrLaCuRuO6 has a simple orthorhombic perovskite structure whereas Sr3LaCuRuO8 and Sr2LaCuRuO7 adopt the 2D K2NiF4 and the intermediate Ruddlesden-Popper structures. At low temperatures the dc susceptibility data show sharp cusps and a divergence between the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled susceptibilities, characteristics of spin-glass behaviour. The spin-glass properties of these compounds can be ascribed to the competition between the nearest-neighbour and next-nearest-neighbour superexchange interactions. The progressive change in properties, with respect to the decrease in the dimensionality of the crystal structures, is also described. The thermoremanent magnetisation has been recorded as a function of temperature for SrLaCuRuO6 and two distinctive relaxation regimes have been observed. The high-temperature irreversibility in this compound is probably associated with blocking of uncompensated clusters. The time dependence of thermoremanent magnetisation has been also measured for SrLaCuRuO6 and the characteristics parameters are similar to those found in other insulating spin-glass systems.",0
"The results of an inelastic neutron scattering investigation performed on the insulating title compound are presented. The spin dynamic is well described by a relaxation model leading to a quasi-elastic Lorentzian neutron-scattering line. The relaxation rate 1 Ï R is a linear temperature function for T>20 K, which is ascribed to the isotropic and 1-D character of the spin correlations. At T = 20 â 5 K a drastic drop in 1 Ï R is observed reflecting a âcrossoverâ to a highly frustrated 3D-spin glass state.",0
"We report the first measurements oflinear and non-linear ac susceptibility for (NiFe)25Au75 and the results suggest that the system is in a mixed phase i.e. ferromagnetic order coexists with spin glass-like state. We also show that the unique observation of the non-linear term Ï2, measured as the strength of the second harmonic signal (2Ï) is an important physical quantity to establish the coexistence of ferromagnetic and spin glass order because of the breaking of time reversal symmetry. This is supported by similar measurements on reentrant spin glass system Fe1.5Mn1.5Si which will also be presented.",1
"Experimental investigations on flax and glass fabrics reinforced epoxy specimens, i.e. FFRE and GFRE, submitted to fatigue tests are presented in this paper. Samples having [0/90]3S and [Â±45]3S stacking sequences, with similar fibre volume fractions have been tested under tensionâtension fatigue loading. The specific stress-number of cycles to failure (SâN) curves, show that for the [0/90]3S specimens, FFRE have lower fatigue endurance than GFRE, but the [Â±45]3S FFRE specimens offer better specific fatigue endurance than similar GFRE, in the studied life range (<2Ã106). Overall, the three-stage stiffness degradation is observed in all cases except for [0/90]3S FFRE specimens, which present a stiffening phenomenon of around 2â3% which could be related to the straightening of the microfibrils.",0
"The pulverization of Fe78B13Si9 melt-spun ribbon to powder was studied. Extended pulverization of ribbon, that had been initially embrittled by annealing, was found to lead to at least partial recovery of malleability as observed by scanning electron microscopy. It is concluded that this results from the re-introduction of excess free volume promoted by plastic deformation at elevated temperatures. This is supported by measurements of Curie temperature Tc which indicated that, following the 10Â°C increase resulting from structural relaxation during the initial embrittling anneal, Tc decreased again by some 8Â°C as a result of the extended pulverization.",0
"Tm3+/Ho3+/Yb3+ triply doped aluminum germanate glasses exhibiting multicolor upconversion fluorescences have been fabricated and characterized. Efficient three-photon blue upconversion emission of Tm3+ and two-photon green and red upconversion fluorescences of Ho3+ have been observed. The strong red emission of Ho3+, which is more than eight times higher than that of the green emission, is desirable in achieving high color rendering index. By varying the excitation power of the 974nm wavelength laser diode, a series of white fluorescences with a large range of correlated color temperature (CCT) was obtained, and the fluorescence colors can be tuned from yellowish white to warm white, pure white, cool white, and bluish white with different CCT. The upconversion color tunability via pump power adjustment will promote the development of three-dimensional solid-state displays and upconversion illumination devices.",1
"The pyrochlore-structure material Y2Mo2O7 is apparently a well-ordered crystalline compound with a concentrated magnetic, Mo4+, sublattice. Yet, the magnetic properties are typical of spin glasses. There is a maximum in the zero-field cooled susceptibility at 22K, no long range magnetic order at 4.2 K, sample-history dependent behavior below 22 K and Curie-Weiss law deviations below 80 K. The effective magnetic moment is 2.06 Î¼B Mo4+ and Î¸ c = â61 K . The spin-glass-like properties are attributed to a frustrated Mo4+ sublattice with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.",0
"Blue, even ultraviolet emissions and very strong red emissions have been observed in ZBLAN glass doped with Tm3+ under 800nm CW laser excitation. The red emissions were demonstrated to be of sequential two-photon process, while the ultraviolet emissions be of three-photon process, according to the intensity dependence.",1
"The incorporation of natural fibres such as sisal/jute with glass fiber composites has gained increasing applications both in many areas of Engineering and Technology. The aim of this study is to evaluate mechanical properties such as tensile and flexural properties of hybrid glass fiber-sisal/jute reinforced epoxy composites. Microscopic examinations are carried out to analyze the interfacial characteristics of materials, internal structure of the fractured surfaces and material failure morphology by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The results indicated that the incorporation of sisal fiber with GFRP exhibited superior properties than the jute fiber reinforced GFRP composites in tensile properties and jute fiber reinforced GFRP composites performed better in flexural properties.",0
"A high conversion efficiency is a key factor for phosphor applications. Because the number of studies on the 5dâ4f emissions of Pr3+ in oxide glasses has been limited, it is worth examining the relationship between the luminescence properties of Pr3+ and the chemical composition of the glass. Herein, we demonstrate the luminescence properties of Pr3+-doped aluminosilicate glasses. Although the internal quantum efficiency is not as high as that of conventional Ce3+-doped glasses, a faster decay (on the order of nanoseconds) is attractive for many different applications. An emissions band can be observed under X-ray irradiation, which differs significantly from photoluminescence. Although the Pr3+âP-codoped samples exhibit higher quantum efficiency than P-free glass owing to a blue shift of the optical absorption edge, the effect of P doping was not observed during X-ray induced scintillation or in the pulse height spectra under 252Cf irradiation.",1
"Erbium-doped lead silicate glass has been investigated for near-infrared emission and up-conversion applications. Near-infrared emission due to 4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ is relatively broad (70.5nm) and long-lived (3.7ms). Also, up-conversion luminescence spectra of Er3+ ions in lead silicate glass have been examined as a function of temperature. The relative intensities of luminescence bands corresponding to 2H11/2 â 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 â 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ were determined with temperature. The fluorescence intensity ratio and temperature sensitivity were calculated. The maximum sensitivity for Er3+ doped lead silicate glass is close to 26.4Ã10â4 Kâ1 at T=590K.",1
"This paper describes experimental studies of the distribution of crystal field sites occupied by Cr3+ ions in different glasses. The effects of this site-to-site disorder on the optical band shape of 4T2 â 4A2 and 2E â 4A2 transitio ns and their temperature dependences are calculated, on the assumption that the disorder distribution function is a Gaussian and compared with experimental results.",1
We report the characteristic photoluminescence (PL) behavior in Ge1âx S x (0.60â¦xâ¦0.90) chalogenide glasses. The compositional and excitation energy dependence of the PL spectra has been investigated. The PL spectra observed near 2.0 eV are strongly suggested to be the result of the recombination process between the photo-excited electrons at the bottom of the conduction band and holes in the defect levels based on their compositional dependence. We also found that the PL intensity is directly related to the concentration of neutral defects. Reduction of the PL through prolonged irradiation by excitation light has also been investigated and is found to recover after relaxation in the dark at room temperature. The states in the bandgap of the GeâS chalcogenide glasses and their changes due to photo-irradiation are discussed.,1
"In this paper, a detailed study of fracture toughness and fatigue behaviour analysis of Spider silk and S-glass epoxy is presented. The usage of synthetic composite fibers is being increased rapidly. However it is expected that, the continuous applications of these fibers in the aerospace sector may tend to decline in the near future in the light of availability of natural fibers. The semi-natural composite proposed in the present work consists of dragline Spider silk as natural fiber and epoxy as matrix. In the world of natural fibers, Spider silk is recognized as the wonder fiber for its unique combination of high strength and rupture elongation. The orientation of the fiber in the matrix is made with reference to the failure resistance of each orientation. The fracture toughness and fatigue life of Spider silk and S-glass epoxy is analyzed using data from literature and verified by FEM (finite element method) simulations. The fracture toughness, stress-strain behaviour and failure of the Spider silk epoxy composite are compared with that of S-glass epoxy composite. The results show that the Spider silk epoxy composite exhibits higher toughness and lesser failure at high stress levels. Therefore it is concluded that Spider silk epoxy composite could be a better replacement for S-glass epoxy composite for the prospect of potential green composite technology in aerospace industries.",0
We present a brief review of phenomenological applications of the gluon saturation approach to the proton-nucleus collisions at high energies.,0
"Er3+ doped and Er3+âYb3+ co-doped ZnOâWO3âB2O3âSiO2 glass-ceramics have been prepared by melt-crystallization method and their properties are examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results reveal that Er3+ ions or Er3+âYb3+ ions have already entered into the crystalline field. The up-conversion mechanism of Er3+âYb3+ co-doped ZnOâWO3âB2O3âSiO2 glass ceramics is analyzed, and the effect of Yb3+ concentration on the intensity of up-conversion is investigated. With the increase of pump power, the intensity of green emission at 530Â nm increases faster than that at 552Â nm. The fluorescence spectrum reaches a maximum when the molar ratio of Er2O3 to Yb2O3 is 1:7.",1
"This paper reports on the mechanical behaviour of a ship structure composite, reinforced by glass fibres of type DF1400, under increasing compressive strain rates ranging from 0.001 to 10 sâ1. The constituents of the composites (reinforcing glass fibres and resin) were similar to those used in the shell and bulkhead structures of The Royal Australian Navy's minehunter ships. Experiments were carried out using a servo hydraulic testing machine and the application of loading was in the normal (through thickness) and in-plane orientation of the laminated specimens. Properties measured were ultimate strength, elastic modulus and strain at ultimate strength. Post failure analysis of specimens was carried out using optical microscopy in order to understand failure mechanisms.",0
"Low-field (2â100 Amâ1) ac magnetic susceptibility measurements (T = 4.2â70 K) on a set of Cu99âx Au x Fe1 alloys (x=12, 37, 50.7 at%) show cusp-like peaks in susceptibility indicating spin glass behaviour. The freezing temperature are in the range T fâ6â8 K. The susceptibility data are found to deviate from extrapolated high temperature (T â¥ 3T f) Curie-Weiss-like behaviour in a manner consistent with the existence of couplings of a predominantly antiferromagnetic nature in Cu62Au37Fe1 and of a ferromagnetic nature in the expanded lattice of Cu48.3Au50.7Fe1. The Cu87Au12Fe1 sample exhibits behaviour consistent with a balance of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange couplings.",0
"Structural, vibrational, photoluminescence and photo electron spectroscopic properties of rf magnetron sputtered ZnO films grown on unheated glass substrates are discussed. Variations in the c-axis orientation, average crystallite size, residual stress, and presence of disoriented grains, with varying oxygen content (40%â100%) during film growth are found to correlate with variation in the E2(high) and A1(LO) modes of the Raman spectra. Room temperature photoluminescence (RTPL) spectra exhibit a characteristic splitting in the near-band-edge emission (NBE) with three emission peaks (around 355, 386 and 395Â nm) under an excitation wavelength of 290Â nm. The blue emission (443â455Â nm) is significantly controlled by oxygen vacancies and seen in films grown under 80% oxygen content. Quenching of NBE emission, for films prepared under oxygen rich ambient, is caused by the increased non-radiative recombination centers owing to reduced size of ZnO nano-crystallites. The shifts in the optical band gap of films grown under different oxygen content supplement the observed changes in the nano-crystallite size and luminescence properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the fractional changes in the oxygen vacancy content in films deposited under different oxygen content in the sputtering gas.",0
"In order to understand the glass transition properties of carbohydrate polymerâplasticizer systems, glass transition temperatures of dextrinâglucose and dextrinâmaltose systems were investigated systematically using differential scanning calorimetry. The onset (T g on) and offset (T g off) of the glass transition decreased with increasing plasticizer (glucose or maltose) content, and showed an abrupt depression at certain plasticizer content. The abrupt depression of T g off occurred at higher plasticizer content than that of T g on. The glass transition was much broader for intermediate plasticizer content. From the enthalpy relaxation behavior of samples aged at various temperatures, it was found that two different glass transitions occurred contentiously in the broad glass transition. These results suggested that carbohydrate polymerâplasticizer systems can be classified into three regions: the entrapment of the plasticizer by the polymer, the formations of the polymerâplasticizer and plasticizer-rich domains, and the embedment of polymer into the plasticizer.",0
"We present a set of measurements of the resistivity in Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy as a function of the temperature T at fixed magnetic field H, Ï±H(T), and as a function of H at fixed T, Ï±T(H), at different angles Ï between H and the (a,b) plane. In the Ï±T(H) experiments an onset field for the resistivity Hâ is detectable, and it has the same angular behavior as the upper critical field Hc2 in traditional layered superconductors: Hâ presents a round or cusp-like maximum when the magnetic field is directed close to the (a,b) plane, depending on the temperature. Hâ in perpendicular orientation is found to lie on the irreversibility line. Assuming that the irreversibility line is a critical field line for a glass-to-liquid transition, we show that a phenomenological model where the leading dissipative term is the phase slippage of the flux lines over a disordered network of inhomogeneities of the order parameter, with an activation process given by a Vogel-FÃ¼lcher equation, can fit all the data from low temperatures up to Tc.",1
The non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of ZrF4î¸BaF2 and ZrF4î¸BaF2î¸NaFî¸AlF3 glasses was studied on the basis of the method for determining the activation energy for crystal growth from DSC curves of various heating rates. It was found that the rate of crystal growth in ZrF4î¸BaF2 glasses was shown to be controlled by viscosity of glasses and that the rate of crystal growth in ZrF4î¸BaF2î¸NaFî¸AlF3 glasses was controlled by diffusion.,1
"The thermal and mechanical properties of a Zr66.4Nb6.4Cu10.5Ni8.7Al8.0 bulk metallic glass composite (BMGC) have been investigated. The thermal properties were determined by using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), while the phase and composition analysis of crystalline precipitates within glassy matrix were carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The deformation behavior has also been investigated through a series of compression tests performed under several strain rates between 10â4 sâ1 and 10â2 sâ1 at various temperatures within supercooled liquid region (SLR). This BMG composite was found to have improved high temperature strength compared to other Zr-based monolithic BMGs. The in situ formed crystalline phases are believed to hinder the viscous flow of glassy matrix to raise the high temperature strength, compensating more the minor softening of crystalline phases at higher temperatures within the SLR. The warm formability of the composite was also estimated by applying the dynamic materials model (DMM) and the results were verified by subsequent laboratory-scale extrusion tests.",0
Silica gels were prepared by two different methods: (1) destabilization of a silica hydrosol (gel 1); (2) hydrolysis and polycondensation of a tetra-methoxysilane (gel 2). The crystallization of the gels was then studied as a function of the temperature by means of X-ray diffraction. It was evident that the crystallization was strongly influenced by the amount of alkali oxides present in the gel. It is effectively the concentration of akali impurities which could explain the lower temperature of crystallization necessary for gel 1 compared with that of gel 2. During the crystallization of the gel containing Na2O the crystalline phase of silica which appears first is the cristobalite; with Li2O it is quartz. The effect of additives such as boric anhydride was studied. This oxide was found to reduce the tendency of the gels to crystallize. The glasses of the system SiO2î¸B2O3 obtained by the hot-pressing of the gels confirmed this phenomenon. Above 10 mol% B2O3 it was impossible to crystallize the gels and the glasses of this system under two hours.,1
"Two-phase amorphous and two-phase crystalline Ni58.2Nb20.25Y21.25 alloy samples with coexisting Y-rich and Nb-rich phase fractions were produced by melt-spinning and copper mould casting. Their electrochemical reactivity in the as-quenched or mechanically polished state and after HNO3/HF solution treatment was investigated in nitrogen-purged 0.1M NaOH solution (pH=13) by means of potentiodynamic polarisation experiments. In the as-quenched state the two-phase amorphous samples are blocked by a strong passive layer. The main effect of a HNO3/HF treatment is a selective dissolution of Y-rich phases leading to an excavation of Nb-rich phase regions, i.e. amorphous NiâNbâ(Y) spheres or Nb6Ni7 grains. The enhanced reactivity of etched Ni58.2Nb20.25Y21.25 ribbons is mainly related to the high reactivity of the residual Y-rich matrix phase, while the Nb-rich spheres with smooth and non-defective surface appear quite inactive. In contrast, in the case of the etched crystalline counterpart the Nb6Ni7 grains provide a highly defective and thus, active surface, which can contribute to an enhanced electrochemical reactivity. The high cathodic performance of a commercial Ni foam for the hydrogen evolution reaction is reached for etched two-phase amorphous and crystalline Ni58.2Nb20.25Y21.25 alloys.",0
"With rapid advances in the electronic industry, the management of cathode ray tube (CRT) glass waste has become a major environmental problem. In this study, 25% Ordinary Portland cement was replaced by Fly ash (FA) or Ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS), the crushed CRT funnel glass sand untreated with nitric acid (n-TFG) was used to replace river sand fine aggregate of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% in the mortar. The fresh, mechanical properties of the mortar were studied, the alkaliâsilica reaction (ASR) expansion, drying shrinkage and leaching of lead from mortar were evaluated. The test results showed, the use of n-TFG glass sand improves fresh properties of the mortar. The mortar with n-TFG glass sand has higher mechanical properties than control mortar. At the drying shrinkage period of 56days, drying shrinkage of nearly all the mortar with n-TFG glass sand are higher than the limit of 0.075%. ASR expansion of the mortar are found to be below 0.1% at 14days tested age, except the mortar with GGBFS and 75% n-TFG glass sand. The lead leaching from mortar with n-TFG glass sand was reduced comparing the content of the leachable lead from n-TFG glass sand. Moreover, at a given replacement level of n-TFG glass sand, FA series mortar has better fresh properties, a lower wet density, mechanical properties, drying shrinkage, ASR expansion and the leaching of lead than GGBFS series mortar.",0
"This paper reports on different physical and absorption spectral properties of Nd3+-doped calcium lanthanum borate glasses with and without Ta2O5 content to understand its influences on the hypersensitive absorption band intensities. From the recorded absorption spectra, JuddâOfelt intensity parameters (Î© Î» , Î» =2, 4, 6) have been calculated and are used to compute the radiative properties of the Nd3+:glasses. The calculated JuddâOfelt parameters are found to be increasing with the increased substitution of calcium for lanthanum in the glass composition, which may be due to the increase of NdâO bond covalency. The glass with the tantalum (Ta5+) as one of the constituent, has displayed a significant increase in the intensity of the hypersensitive transition (4 I 9/2 â 4 G 5/2, 2 G 7/2) of Nd3+ ions which is attributed to the asymmetry around the rare earth ion site aroused due to the occurrence of structural changes in the glass network and as well as mixed cationic effect with the addition of Ta5+ ions. Besides the spectral property analysis, different important physical properties have also been investigated from the measured density and refractive indices. The substitution of lanthanum with calcium increases the optical basicity of the glass with an increase in the oxide ion polarisability.",1
"A theory of the ionic conductivity in polymer electrolytes based on defect diffusion is evaluated using previously published data. Those data include the pressure and temperature variation of the electrical conductivity for poly(dimethylsiloxane-ethylene-oxide) complexed with NaCF3COO. In the defect diffusion model, ion transport is controlled by defects and ion motion occurs when the ion is encountered by a single defect. As temperature is lowered or pressure increases, the number of single defects decreases, thus decreasing the ionic conductivity. Further, there exists a pressure-dependent critical temperature, T c, below which single defects do not exist. It is shown how the pressure dependence of the conductivity is controlled by the pressure dependence of T c. The theory is used to predict the variation with temperature of both the apparent activation volume and curvature in plots of the logarithm of the conductivity with pressure.",0
The current-time and non-linear current-voltage characteristics in the Cu0.15As0.35Se0.50 chalcogenide semiconductor glass are analyzed. From the measurements it is deduced that the electrical conductance varies according to G 0 exp( V V0 ). The role played by Joule heating in the switching phenomenon is investigated. Results obtained for the delay time are in agreement with solutions given by the thermal balance equation for the impulse breakdown limiting case.,1
"This work focuses on developing a novel convenient method for electroless copper deposition on glass material. This method is relied on the formation of amino (NH2)-terminated film on the surface of glass substrate, by coating polyethylenimine (PEI) on glass matrix and using epichlorohydrin (ECH) as cross-linking agent. The introduced amino groups can effectively adsorb the palladium, the catalysts which could initiate the subsequent Cu electroless plating, onto the glass substrate surface. Finally, a copper film is formed on the palladium-activated glass substrate through copper electroless plating and the surface-coppered glass material is therefore acquired. X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images combined with energy diffraction X-ray (EDX) analysis demonstrate the successful copper deposition on the surface of glass substrate.",0
"The improvement of mechanical properties of carbon nanotubeâreinforced polycrystalline ceramic or glass matrix composites was limited in earlier studies by the difficulties in producing a good dispersion of carbon nanotubes. Additionally, a proper understanding of the reinforcing mechanisms, if any, affecting the mechanical properties of ceramics containing carbon nanotubes is still lacking. We report here the effects of a good dispersion of as much as 10wt.% multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the mechanical properties of dense alumino-borosilicate glass ceramics (ABS) prepared by an ultrasonication-assisted solâgel technique followed by hot pressing (950Â°C; 2h; Ar atmosphere). The fracture toughness and flexural strength of the nanocomposites increased with increasing MWCNT content up to 10wt.%. The ABSâ10wt.% MWCNT nanocomposite possessed nearly double the strength of the unreinforced ABS, accompanied by â¼150% improvement in fracture toughness. However, a further increase in MWCNT content to 15wt.% resulted in a modest deterioration of the mechanical properties due to agglomeration of the MWCNTs. The carbon nanotubes have been observed to bridge crack openings of the order of â¼100nm and the experimental evidence, along with theoretical analysis, showed that crack bridging provided the major contribution towards the improvement in fracture toughness. Debonding between the MWCNTs and the matrix appeared to occur in the matrix, away from the actual interface. However, the absence of significant pull-out of broken sections of the MWCNTs during fracture, due to failure of the bridging CNTs being predominantly at the crack plane, indicates that further toughening may be available if this mechanism can be activated.",0
"In this work, five levels of dispersant concentrations were used to prepare cordierite-based glass ceramic suspensions with different solid loadings. The Bingham model could be used to characterise rheological behaviour of 50 wt.% solid loaded suspensions, whereas it gradually changed to shear thickening at higher dispersant concentrations as the solid loadings further increased (60, 70 wt.%). A critical dispersant concentration, which provided the lowest stress, was obtained at 0.6 wt.% for Dolapix. The particle size ratio between cordierite and glass powder also plays an important role in rheological properties of the suspensions and green densities. The green density increased as the solid loadings in the suspensions further increased.",1
"High accuracy specific heat experiments in closely spaced fields from 0 to 14 T are reported for a 0.3 g crystal of YBa2Cu3O x . Specific heat steps are consistently observed on a line B m(T) that is well separated from the upper critical field cross-over B c2(T). Such second-order transitions are predicted to occur when a vortex glass melts. The B m(T) line is studied for different oxygen concentrations, using the same sample. The anisotropy of the melting field B m and that of the upper critical field B c2 are found to be equal. B m is nearly proportional to the mass anisotropy ratio (m ab/m c)1/2<1. The lines B m(T) and B c2(T) move in opposite directions when the anisotropy increases. The XY critical scaling properties of the specific heat step, the analytical shape of the transition line B m(T)â(1âT/T c)â4/3 and the observation of critical points are consistent with a second-order transition. The transition line B m(T) coincides with that of high purity YBa2Cu3O x crystals with reduced pinning and for which first-order transitions have been reported.",0
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the shear bond strengths of a self-cured glass ionomer versus composite cement for bonding of stainless steel buttons with various enamel surface and setting conditions. Materials and Methods: Stainless steel orthodontic buttons were bonded using composite material under 3 different enamel and setting conditions: 1) conditioned and dry enamel surface, 2) conditioned and precontamination of the enamel surface with blood before bonding, 3) conditioned and immediate blood contamination postbonding and were compared with 3 different enamel conditions and setting for bonding with the glass ionomer cement: 1) nonconditioned and wet enamel surfaces, 2) nonconditioned and blood contamination of enamel before bonding, and 3) nonconditioned and immediate blood contamination postbonding. The brackets were bonded to 109 recently extracted teeth and allowed to set in a moist plastic container for 24 hours. They were subsequently tested in shear mode with a universal testing machine. The maximum bond strength and the site of bond failure were recorded. In addition, the location of the bond failure was studied. Results: Composite was capable of sustaining greater forces than the resin-modified glass ionomer materials. Hence, it took more force to debond a bracket cemented with composite than with resin-modified glass ionomer. The effect of contamination was similar in both of the materials, and the magnitude of the decrease in bond strength was nearly of the same proportion. The postcontamination values were not significantly different from the uncontaminated bond strength for either material. The type of bond failure was significantly different for the different materials, and there were significant differences among the treatment conditions. Conclusion: Composite resin had significantly greater shear strength than resin-reinforced glass ionomer cement. Both materials showed a significant decrease in bond strength when precontaminated with blood. The postcontamination values were not significantly different from the uncontaminated bond strength for either material.

"In this paper we develop the optical pumping system based on 805 nm laser diode as photo-pumped source. Laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm is used as reference source and passed in a laser glass medium. Laser glass medium was synthesized from chemical compositions of (65-x)B2O3-15Na2O-10PbO-5ZnO-5Li2O-xNd2O3 (with x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0). The emission spectra confirms that there are three emission peaks located at 946 nm, 1064 nm and 1350 nm corresponding to 4F3/2Â®4I9/2, 4F3/2Â®4I11/2 and 4F3/2Â®4I13/2 respectively. The emission cross section relatively higher for the 4F3/2Â®4I11/2 transition shows the compatibility of these glasses for near infra-red laser application. The measurements of optical gain had been carried out by using lock-in amplifier with voltage as output signal. From output voltage converted to optical gain in dB. The glass medium with 1.0 Nd3+ label was obtained the maximum optical gain with incident power 900 mW.",1
"The world today is experiencing a significant global warming problem. One of the causes of the problem is due to the use of excessive and uncontrollable material. Therefore, replacing the material with more environmental friendly is a challenging task, especially from wasted natural materials such as rice husk (RH) fiber. The aim of the study is to investigate the mechanical properties from composites made by reinforcing bi-directional glass fiber and RH short fiber with epoxy resin. Total of fibers content for each sample was 30â¯wt% and 70â¯wt% for epoxy resin. The weight distributions for RH fiber were ranging from 5â¯wt%, 10â¯wt% and 15â¯wt%, meanwhile 25â¯wt%, 20â¯wt% and 15â¯wt% for bi-directional glass fiber. The arrangement of fibers were alternate layers and hand lay-up for fabrication of hybrid composite. The best combination of hybrid composite was 5â¯wt% of RH fiber and 25â¯wt% of glass fiber with tensile strength value 215.42â¯MPa, tensile modulus 1.8 GPa, flexural strength 275.51â¯MPa and impact strength 447.19â¯J/m. It was indicated that the decreasing trend on its mechanical properties when the content of RH fiber exceeds 5â¯wt%.",0
"The dry friction of an amorphous alloy (Fe40Ni40P14B6) has been studied to analyse the first stages of surface degradation. After characterization of the first layers and of the surface roughness in the as-cast condition, the self-friction of this material is analysed. The role played by the oxides formed in the contact is to promote progressively an abrasive wear mechanism. It is noted that the ferrite devitrification product of the amorphous material formed during the friction has a preferred orientation, which is the same as that formed during heat treatment at low temperature.",0
"The 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, together with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), have been used to investigate the phase separation in 15Na2Oâ85B2O3 binary glass. Based on the present investigation we suggest that the phase equilibrium in sodium borate glasses is controlled by the rate competition of the nucleation and crystal growth between two immiscible phases rather than those being proposed by the conventional phase diagram. The experimental results show that the sodium-rich phase, after being heat-treated at 500Â°C, was not Na2O.4B2O3, as indicated by phase diagram. The over-coordination of oxygen atoms in the sodium-rich phase rendered difficulties in the crystallization of the sodium-rich phase with less than 75 mol % sodium oxide. Therefore, the high growth rate of the boron-rich phase can force the residual glass toward much higher concentrations of sodium oxide. According to the NMR measurements, it was found that, after reaching equilibrium, the 15Na2Oâ85B2O3 glass separated into Na2O.9B2O3 and 3Na2O.B2O3.",1
"In order to contribute to the ongoing debate on the atomic structure of Se-rich Ge x Se1â x glasses, we have studied the structure of glassy GeSe4 by first-principles molecular dynamics. The PerdewâBurkeâErnzerhof generalized gradient approximation has been employed. The nearest-neighbor Se environment is found to be compatible with the coexistence of a network of GeSe4 tetrahedra and Se n chains, thereby confirming previous PerdewâWang results. When comparing PW and PBE results, changes are found in the GeâGe coordination environment and in the number of GeSe4 tetrahedra. In addition, very extended Se n chains (n >3, up to n =12) are present (PBE case).",1
"The extrinsic size of both crystalline alloys and amorphous metallic alloys strongly affects their mechanical properties at the submicron scale or nanometre scale. For example, Zr-based metallic glass nanopillars exhibit ceramic-like strengths (2.25GPa) and metal-like ductility (25%) simultaneously when the pillar dimension is reduced to <100nm. Here, we report a new compositional design approach to create tough metallic glass composites consisting of micrometre-scale dendrites and nanometre-scale amorphous matrices that exhibit high strength and ductility in the normally brittle MgZnCa metallic glass system. When the thickness of the amorphous matrix is reduced to the nanometre scale, a low density (Ïâ1.99gcmâ3) Mg91.5Zn7.5Ca1 alloy exhibits room temperature tensile ductility exceeding 15.6%, a yield strength of 215MPa and a fracture strength of 478MPa. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrates that the alloy consists of micrometre-scale Î±-Mg solid solution dendrites and nanometre-scale amorphous matrix (80â530nm in thickness). The homogeneous deformation of nanometre scale amorphous matrices is believed to be responsible for the high toughness and excellent work-hardening behaviour.",0
"By optimizing the concentration ratio of Ho/Yb and using conventional melting and quenching methods, a group of Ho/Yb co-doped tellurite glasses with host composition of 78TeO2â12ZnOâ10Na2O (mol.%, TZN) were made for red fiber laser development. Excited by 976nm laser diode, intense green and red emissions were detected easily even by naked eyes. TZN glass codoped with 0.5wt.% Ho2O3 and 3wt.% Yb2O3 was found to present the strongest red emission with the intensity about three times higher than that of the green one, presenting a yellowish-orange color as observed. Besides direct energy transfer process from Yb to Ho as usual, it is believed that cooperative energy transfer upconversion from a pair of Yb donor ions to one Ho acceptor ion and excited state absorptions among different levels of Ho ion are commonly responsible for the observed intense red emission.

"The 96GeOâ(3-Ï)Al2O3âÏNa2Oâ1NaBiO3 (Ï =0, 0.5, 1.5 molar percent designated as A1, A2 and A3) and 96GeOâ(3.5-Ï)Al2O3âÏNa2Oâ0.5Bi2O3 (Ï =0.5, 1, 2 molar percent designated as B1, B2 and B3) glasses were prepared by conventional melting method with the measurement of their DTA curve, fluorescence decay curve, transmission, absorption and emission spectra. The near infrared superbroadband emission characteristics of the A1, A2, B1 and B2 glasses peak at â¼1220nm were observed when pumped by an 800nm laser diode. The stimulated emission cross section (Ï p) was obtained from the emission spectra. The result indicated that the introduction of Bi5+ in NaBiO3 into raw materials could increase the emission intensity of the obtained glasses by 5.6 times than that of Bi3+ in Bi2O3, and the FWHM (ÎÎ») and emission lifetime (Ï) at 1220nm increased from 195nm to 275nm, and 280Î¼s to 434Î¼s. Meanwhile, it was found that the absorption edges were blue-shifted from 486 to 447nm by comparing those of A1 and B1. The absorption edges were considered to be ascribed to the charge transfer from Bi3+ 6s2 to Bi5+ 6s0. Therefore we could conclude that the content of Bi5+ ions in A1 was more than that in B1 glasses. It could be deduced from the emission and absorption spectra that the stronger emission intensity and wider FWHM were due to the higher concentration of Bi5+ ion in glass. In particular, the increase of Na2O content was in proportion to the thermal stability and the value of Ï p Ã Ï and Ï p ÃÎÎ» of glasses.",1
"An inter-ply hybrid composite consists of at least two types of reinforcements along different plies in fiber-reinforced polymer composites. The tensile behaviour is deteriorated with increasing temperature, which possesses a severe concern that needs to be tackled before incorporating it into engineering applications. The tensile testing was done on the specimens at different temperatures (30â¯Â°C, 70â¯Â°C and 110â¯Â°C) by changing the hybrid ratio with different stacking sequence. The results reveal that by incorporating two layers of carbon fiber at the top end in glass fibers epoxy (GE) composite at 30â¯Â°C enhances the tensile modulus by 76.8% more than the control GE composite. Also, the strain to failure increases by 20.7% than carbon fiber reinforced epoxy (CE) composite by substituting one glass fiber by one carbon fiber at the top end. Although at 110â¯Â°C temperature, strain to failure amplifies by 9.3% than that of CE composite. The dominant modes of failure were observed under scanning electron microscopy of the failed specimens.",0
"Lithium boro tellurite (LBT) glass doped with neodymium oxide has been prepared and characterized by XRD, FTIR and SEM analysis. JuddâOfelt theory has been applied to evaluate the best fit intensity parameters. The trend found in the JO intensity parameter is Î© 6>Î© 4>Î© 2 If Î© 6>Î© 4, the glass system is favourable for the lasing emission 4F3/2â4I11/2 in the IR wavelength.

Stimulated emission cross sections (Ï P E Ã10â20 cm2) for NIR lasing transitions 4F3/2â4I11/2 and 13/2 are 2.67 and 0.83, respectively. Similarly, the lifetimes (Ï mea) have also been measured for both NIR emissions and the values are 60.6 and 46.4Î¼s for this neodymium oxide doped LBT glass.",1
"The data from an investigation of acid solution corrosion of single-phase alkali borosilicate glasses were analyzed in terms of ion interdiffusion enhanced by network hydrolysis. Glasses under study are identical to an equilibrium composition of the chemically unstable phase of the phase-separated glasses, which are usually used to produce a porous glass. Corrosion of a single-phase glass (or an unstable phase of two-phase glass) can be conceived of as chemical dissolution of its components with the precipitation of the low-soluble products as an intermediate stage.",1
"We used a UV-irradiation reduction method to prepare Ag-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite by reducing graphite oxide and silver ion in ethanol. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), UVâvis absorption spectrophotometry (UVâvis), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterized the prepared samples. AgâRGO nanocomposite was tested for reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline under visible light. The AgâRGO nanocomposites have a high efficiency to convert nitrobenzene to aniline under visible-light irradiation. Therefore, Ag-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite can be used as a photocatalyst for organic synthesis.",0
"A biocompatible bulk metallic glass composite (BMGC) alloy with a nominal composition of Ti56Zr6Cu19.8Pd8.4Sn1.8Nb8 was designed to obtain microstructure consisting of Î²-Ti dendrites and glassy matrix. It was found that Nb-rich Î²-Ti dendrites were the primary phase in the alloy, and extra discontinuous island-like Ti2Cu phase was also produced in the glassy matrix. The BMGC alloy presented higher yield strength, remarkably increased plasticity and pronounced work-hardening characteristic. Furthermore, excellent sliding wear resistance was exhibited by the alloy due to the work-hardening capability and the contribution of the Ti2Cu intermetallic phase.",0

The concentration dependence of the transition temperature T g of a spin glass with RKKY interaction is calculated for a system of N = 216 Ising spins distributed randomly on a fcc lattice. The results are in good agreement with experiment. Calculations for the specific heat yield a linear dependence for small T and a 1/T 2 law for high temperatures.

"This work studies the effects of the shear bands on serrated flow of the metallic glass Zrâ5Tiâ17.9Cuâ14.6Niâ10Al using nanoindentation technique and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). It was observed that the nanoindentation loadâdisplacement (Pâh) curves are serrated when the nanoindents were made within the region had pre-introduced shear bands from a spherical indentation made with higher load in the specimen. The results support the earlier observation and assumption that the pre-introduced shear bands intersect with the new shear bands induced by nanoindentations, leading to less pile-up around the nanoindentation impressions. This result is discussed with possible mechanisms of the plastic deformation of the metallic glass materials.",0
"Lines with Er3+-doped CaF2 nanocrystals were patterned by laser irradiations in aluminoborosilicate-based oxyfluoride glasses. The morphology and dispersion state of CaF2 nanocrystals were examined from transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations combined with focused ion beam sample preparations. The size of CaF2 nanocrystals present in the region close to the center of lines was larger than that in the region close to the edge of lines. Micro-photoluminescence (PL) spectra for the line part showed clear emissions corresponding to the fâf transitions of Er3+ ions, and the correlation between the morphology and dispersion state of CaF2 nanocrystals and PL properties (intensity and degree of the Stark splitting) of Er3+ ions incorporated into in CaF2 nanocrystals was clarified. The formation mechanism of CaF2 nanocrystals in the laser irradiated part was discussed from the temperature distribution model.",1
The pinning force F p in a metallic glass superconductor Zr75Cu25 has been measured as a function of perpendicular field and temperature.

"Intense 2.7Â Î¼m emission derived from modified Er3+ doped germanate glass was reported. Raman spectrum analysis was carried out to grasp glass structure. Based on the absorption spectrum, the JuddâOfelt parameters and radiative properties were calculated originated from JuddâOfelt theory. 2.7Â Î¼m emission characteristics, stark splitting features and energy transfer processes upon excitation of a conventional 808Â nm or 980Â nm laser diode were carefully investigated. The prepared glass possesses high spontaneous transition probability (34.28Â sâ1), large calculated emission cross section (13Â ÃÂ 10â21Â cm2) and gain coefficient (5.4Â cmâ1) for the 4I11/2Â âÂ 4I13/2 transition.

"The effects of the gradual substitution of Zr by Hf on glass formability and thermal stability in the Cu45Zr45â x Hf x Ag10 alloys and the effects of small additions of Si on glass formability in the Cu45Zr45Ag10 alloy are reported and discussed. The samples were prepared as ribbons of thickness in the range 25â200Î¼m by melt spinning and as conical bulk shapes, with a length of 50mm and cone base diameters in the range 2â10mm, by suction die casting. The alloy Cu45Zr45Ag10 had a critical cylindrical rod diameter for glass formation, d c, of 3.5mm but substitution of 1.5 and 3.5at.% Zr by Hf resulted in substantial increases to 5.5 and 4.5mm, respectively. However, for x in the range 5â40at.%, d c was reduced to <1mm . The small addition of Si proved to be beneficial to the glass forming ability (GFA), increasing d c up to 5.5mm for 0.5at.% Si. Thus the chemical and atomic size similarities of Hf and Zr do not guarantee that bulk glass formation will be maintained on substituting large proportions of Zr by Hf though small substitutions of Hf and of minor additions of Si were beneficial to the GFA. These effects are discussed in terms of the possible influence of the alloying additions on the liquid structure and on the number density of heterogeneous nucleants.",0
"High temperature in asphalt pavements often leads to rutting of asphalt pavements and heat island effects in urban areas. In this study, to improve the thermal resistance of asphalt pavement, hollow glass microspheres (HGM) modified asphalt and HGM/Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) modified asphalt were used to prepare asphalt concrete (AC) and stone mastic asphalt (SMA) respectively. The effects of HGM on the penetration, ductility, softening point and rheological properties of asphalt binder and the cooling performance, mechanical property, high temperature stability, low temperature resistance, water stability and other properties of asphalt mixture were investigated. Finally, the composition of the thermal resistance surface layer was recommended. Results showed that, adding HGM increased the high temperature stability of both matrix asphalt and SBS modified asphalt while the low temperature performance of both the two types of asphalts decreased. For the asphalt mixture, the addition of HGM improved the cooling performance of the AC-13 mixture but had no effect on the cooling performance of the SMA-13 mixture. HGM also showed positive effects on the pavement performance of the asphalt mixtures. For the AC-13 mixture, it improved the mechanical property, high-temperature stability, low-temperature cracking resistance and immersion residue stability but had no effect on the thaw-splitting strength ratio (TSR). For the SMA-13 mixture, it improved the Marshall stability, high-temperature stability, immersion residue stability, scattering resistance while impaired the low-temperature crack resistance, TSR and anti-drainage ability. Finally, it was recommended to use 5% HGM modified AC-13 mixture as the thermal resistance surface layer.",0
"The Er3+-doped zincfluorophosphate glasses have been prepared by conventional melt-quenching technique and characterized through X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, Raman, visible and near-infrared (NIR) emission spectra and decay time measurements. Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters (Î©Î», Î»Â =Â 2, 4 and 6) have been derived from the absorption spectrum and inturn used to calculate the radiative properties for the fluorescent levels of Er3+ ions. The studied glasses exhibit intense green and weak red emissions under 378Â nm excitation and an intense NIR emission at 1.53Â Î¼m under 980Â nm laser diode excitation. The wavelength dependence of gain cross-section for different values of population inversion (Î³) has been derived from the McCumber theory. Lifetime for the 4I13/2 level of Er3+ ion is found to decrease from 7.17 to 1.42Â ms whereas the gain bandwidth increases from 143.5 to 263.9Â ÃÂ 10â28Â cm3 with increase of Er3+ concentration from 0.001 to 2.0Â mol %.

"In this study laser shock peening (LSP) with multiple laser impacts was used to improve the mechanical properties especially the plasticity of Zr35Ti30Cu8.25Be26.75 bulk metallic glass (BMG) pillars in two aspect ratios (1:1 and 2:1). It was found that, with increasing laser impacts up to 5, the compression plastic strain of BMG pillar with aspect ratio of 1:1 increased from 0 to 1.48% and the compression strength increased significantly from 1569MPa to 1721MPa. With further laser impacts beyond 5, the changes in the plasticity and the compression strength were observed to be insignificant. Considering the effect of sample geometry at the same laser impacts, it could be concluded that the BMG pillars with smaller aspect ratio of 1:1 had better mechanical properties than that of the lager BMG pillars with aspect ratio of 2:1. Besides, the elastic strain limit of BMG pillars with LSP was not only independent of the laser impacts, but also irrelevant to the aspect ratio. At last, we discussed the reason for the increase of plasticity in view of the creation of excess free volume during LSP.",1
"The prevailing utilisation of light and strong structural materials has led to an increasing demand to engineering industries on developing different types of advanced composites. Thus, the development of simple and low cost woven glass fibre composites with an improvement on their tensile and impact properties is suggested. In this paper, the hybridization of a glass fibre reinforced composite is achieved by using low cost short silk fibres as a medium to enhance its cross-ply strength. The comparison on the tensile and impact properties of the composite reinforced by the short silk fibre (with the content from 0.3 to 0.6wt%) with a pristine glass fibre composite sample was conducted. Fracture surfaces were analysed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental results indicated that the maximum Youngâs modulus and ductility index (DI) of a silk reinforced composite increased by 50% and 75%, respectively as compared with the pristine one. Furthermore, the visual examination on drop-weight test samples proved that the impact resistance of the silk reinforced composite was better than that of the pristine sample as well. According to the results obtained, it was found that the addition of 0.4wt% short silk fibre into glass fibre composite was shown to be the advisable reinforcement content to achieve better tensile and impact strengths.",0
"Sheet molding compounds (SMC) allow to design high performance polymer-matrix composites increasingly used for structural applications in the automotive industry. SMC are usually based on an unsaturated polyester thermosetting resin diluted in styrene with chopped glass fibers and fillers. Due to international regulations linked with the potential risks of styrene, replacing such styrene-based reactive system compound is becoming more and more strategic in order to zero-VOC emission, while keeping similar (or displaying even better) mechanical properties and shrinkage control to conventional SMC-based composite materials. In this study, the same sized E-glass fiber was combined with two different vinylester matrices, a conventional styrene containing resin and a styrene free one. The second type fits more suitable for friendly environmentally purposes as it is based on a dimethacrylate diluent. The objective of this work is focused on interfacial adhesion in both systems as the fiber/matrix interface is a key parameter governing the mechanical properties of the final composite materials. A multiscale analysis was carried out from: i)the fiber scale by measuring the interfacial shear stress by using the microdebonding test; ii)the fibers bundle scale by studying the wettability of fibers by the uncured resin; iii)up to the mechanical characterization of unidirectional SMC composites by measuring the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). As main results, it is demonstrated that the styrene-free composites have a suitable interfacial resistance compared to conventional systems whereas impregnation, i.e. specific fiber sizings which will be more soluble in the resin-dimethacrylate reactive system need to be designed.",0
"Time-dependent electrical resistivity measurements are carried out on Asî¸Teî¸Se glasses at different fixed pressure using the Bridgman anvil system. At pressures, p < 18 kbar, the variation of electrical resistivity with time exhibits an exponential behavior, and at pressures p > 18 kbar it shows a stretched exponential behavior. This behavior can be explained on the basis of critical thresholds and fractal dimension of the network glasses.",1
"A Ti-based bulk metallic glass composite showing high fracture strength of 3GPa, large plasticity of 18.3% and strong work-hardening behavior was developed. It was found that the enhanced properties could be mainly attributed to the severely confined deformation of B2-(Ti, Zr)(Cu, Ni) as a result of the precipitation strengthening from the nanosized ZrTiCu2 and CuTi2 phases located in its grain boundaries. Additionally, the occurrence of the strain-induced martensitic transformation of the B2 phase is also beneficial for the macroscopic properties.",0
"In this study the effect of incorporation of Zr based Fe and Ni bearing metallic glass in spot welds in Zircaloy components has been examined. A comparison of strength and microstructure of the welded joint with and without glass has been carried out. The welded joint with metallic glass has been found to be stronger than the one without metallic glass. The microstructure of the welded region with metallic glass has been found to comprise a large region having martensite. This large martensitic region has also been found to have considerable amount of excess solute (Fe, Ni). The higher strength of the weld with metallic glass seems to originate due to solid solution strengthening, small grain size and the presence of martensitic structure over a large region.",0
"Yb3+-doped tellurite glasses exhibited largest absorption and emission cross sections. However, it is more valuable to achieve larger Stark splitting of Yb3+ than improve the absorption and emission cross sections. In this work, we introduced a part of GeO2 into tellurite glass matrix to enlarge the Stark splitting of Yb3+. The effects of GeO2 concentration on the spectroscopic characteristic of Yb3+ were systematically investigated. The stimulated absorption and emission cross sections increased to be 1.62â¯pm2 and 0.88â¯pm2 when the GeO2 concentration up to 30â¯mol%, then decreased with the GeO2 concentration further increased. The Stark splitting of Yb3+ do not change until the GeO2 concentration up to 30â¯mol%. The NIR fluorescence lifetimes of Yb3+ drastically decreased from 850â¯Î¼s to 385â¯Î¼s with the GeO2 concentration increasing, which was due to the increasing multi-phonon relaxation rate and reabsorption. Intense NIR fluorescence were observed when excited by the ultraviolet light, which can be ascribed to the energy transfer from the CTB of Yb3+-O2- couple to Yb3+. The CTB showed a slight blue-shift from 338 to 313â¯nm with GeO2 concentration increasing, which was ascribed to the size of the cation site would increase.",1
"The switching properties previous to the memory effects of bulk chalcogeni de semiconductor glasses in the Al-As-Te system are investigated. The values of the switching voltage are related to the glass transition temperatures as well as to glass composition and a linear relation between ln V th and Te at% is found. A constant electrical power for switching occurrence has been found. The behaviour of the switching voltage V th with temperatures ranging from room temperature to 100Â°C follows an exponential law previously reported by other authors. The delay time versus applied voltage shows a typical glass bulk behaviour. The experimental results support an electrothermal model for switching in this system for the used conditions, although a low-field dependence must be introduced for a complete agreement.",1
We report the development of a novel light-weight Al (520) alloy-based composite reinforced with particles of a Cu-based (Cu54Zr36Ti10) metallic glass by mechanical milling followed by induction heated sintering. The consolidation of the composite is performed at a temperature in the super-cooled liquid region of the metallic glass just above its glass-transition temperature (Tg ). Metallic glasses are a promising alternative reinforcement material for metal-matrix composites capable of producing significant strengthening along with a Â«friendlyÂ» sintering behavior. The mechanical milling procedures were properly established to allow reduction of the size of the metallic glass particles and their uniform distribution in the matrix. Microstructural observation of the composite did not reveal any porosity. The interface between the glassy particles and the matrix remained free of such defects. The fully dense consolidated composite showed a drastic gain in specific yield strength under compression relative to the matrix alloy and appreciable plasticity at fracture.,0
"This paper reports the design and synthesis of the in situ intermetallic-phase reinforced amorphous-matrix composite (Mg65Cu10Ni10Y10Zn5)91Zr9. In situ formed intermetallic ZrNi particles significantly improve the mechanical properties of the composite.

The mechanism governing the formation of the intermetallic phase and the beneficial effect of the hard intermetallic particles on the deformation and fracture of the composite is discussed.",0
"We have studied the electronic structure of glassy Pd-U-Si alloys by photoelectron spectroscopy. The U-rich alloys exhibit a narrow 5f band at the Fermi level and 4f core levels similar to those observed in polycrystalline Î±-uranium, clearly indicating the trivalent 5f3 configuration as previously found in glassy binary U-rich alloys with Fe, Co and Ni. A qualitatively different behaviour has been found in the dilute alloy (Pd95U5)83Si17 both in the valence band spectra and the core levels which has been interpreted in terms of the tetravalent 5f2 configuration.",0
"Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have been reported to have large variability in mode I fracture toughness. In this study, alternating soft and hard regions were created in a Zr52.5Ti5Cu18Ni14.5Al10 (at%) BMG via mechanical imprinting at room temperature. While only 50% of as-cast samples demonstrated plastic deformation during mode I fracture tests, 100% of imprinted samples demonstrated measurable plasticity and the scatter in measured mode I fracture toughness was significantly reduced. Mechanical treatments show promise for improving the fracture reliability of BMGs.",0
"ESR spectra and electron spin relaxation of nitroxide radical in 4-oxo-TEMPO-d16-15N in propylene glycol were studied at X-band in the temperature range 10â295K. The spinâlattice relaxation in the liquid viscous state determined from the resonance line shape is governed by three mechanisms occurring during isotropic molecular reorientations. In the glassy state below 200K the spinâlattice relaxation, phase relaxation and electron spin echo envelope modulations (ESEEM) were studied by pulse spin echo technique using 2-pulse and 3-pulse induced signals. Electron spinâlattice relaxation is governed by a single non-phonon relaxation process produced by localized oscillators of energy 76cmâ1. Electron spin dephasing is dominated by a molecular motion producing a resonance-type peak in the temperature dependence of the dephasing rate around 120K. The origin of the peak is discussed and a simple method for the peak shape analysis is proposed, which gives the activation energy of a thermally activated motion Ea =7.8kJ/mol and correlation time Ï 0 =10â8 s. The spin echo amplitude is strongly modulated and FT spectrum contains a doublet of lines centered around the 2D nuclei Zeeman frequency. The splitting into the doublet is discussed as due to a weak hyperfine coupling of nitroxide unpaired electron with deuterium of reorienting CD3 groups.",0
"The present paper deals with the preparation of alternative filler based on the waste from glass production and its application into polymer materials. In the function of alternative filler was used sludge from weighing the ingredients in preparation process of glass batch in the glass production. This alternative filler has been modified in order to increase its efficiency, using the three silanes: 3-(Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane, bis3-(Triethoxysilyl) propyl-tetrasulfide and 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl-methacrylate. Prepared modified fillers were mixed into rubber compounds as a partial replacement of commonly used filler â carbon black. The difference of rubber compounds were in the amount of modified filler and in the type of silane used too. The prepared rubber samples were characterized by determination of the rheology and curing characteristics and physical-mechanical properties. The topography and microrelief of the filler particles before and after the modification and the microstructure of vulcanizates containing alternative fillers were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that studied waste from glass production can be used in the function of alternative filler to rubber. The used targeted modifications of alternative filler showed a favorable effect on the properties of prepared rubber compounds and vulcanizates.",0

The absorption coefficient rises more rapidly for than for as expected. In both cases, an approximately squared dependence on wave number is observed. The gap is also shown to disappear smoothly through the insulator-metal transition.",0
"Hardness (H) and Young modulus (E) of three different chemical compositions of Zr-based bulk metallic glasses were investigated through the use of nanoindentation. The effects of the chemical composition and microstructure of bulk metallic glasses on mechanical properties were examined. Additionally, plastic deformation of studied alloys during nanoindentation's measurements, with different indentationâloading rates was carried out. The increase in hardness with the increase of crystalline volume fraction (V cr) for all alloys was observed. Increasing V cr, Young modulus of studied alloys increases almost linearly in the range up to about 75%. For fully crystalline alloys small decrease of Young modulus is observed. Alloy C, containing the highest Al amount, exhibits the highest values of H and E among all studied alloys. It was noticed that plastic deformation of amorphous alloys is punctuated by many discrete bursts of rapid displacement. This behaviour showed to be strongly depended on the indentationâloading rate. As the loading rate is increased, the nature of serrated flow observed on loadâdisplacement (Pâh) curves, changes significantly. Low rates Pâh curves exhibit characteristic serrations, while curves obtained at higher rates are smoother. The character of plastic deformation of partially crystallised alloys was analysed, as well. For those materials, the change in the nature of the plastic deformation, from serrated to non-serrated flow, is observed at lower indentation rates, as compared to results obtained for amorphous alloys.",0
"In previous years there has been great interest in new materials for photonic devices operating at infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) regions. We report here near infrared and blue cooperative luminescence properties for Yb3+-doped GeO2âPbO glasses. Luminescence and lifetime measurements in the VIS and near-IR regions were performed to investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of the glasses. Intense emissions around 507 and 1010nm were observed using 980 and 808nm excitation, respectively. The VIS lifetimes (â¼0.4ms) are about half of their respective near infrared ones (â¼0.8ms), as expected for materials in which the VIS emission is caused by the cooperative effect. Regarding the IR emission, the glasses exhibited a high absorption cross-section (1.2Ã10â20 cm2) at 978nm and an emission cross-section of 0.6Ã10â20 cm2, at 1010nm, with a minimum pump intensity of 2.8kW/cm2. These results suggest this glass composition as a potential material to be used in devices operating in the VIS and IR spectral range, such as 3-D displays and infrared lasers.",1
Low field magnetic susceptibility of a glassy semiconductor (Sb2S3) x (SbI3) y Fe z reveals a spin glass-like behaviour in spite of the sample not being metallic. The critical temperature is observed to depend on the concentration of the iron atoms (T M = 0.179z 0.76).,0
"The hardness and Young'modulus for two Cu-based bulk metallic glasses, Cu59Zr36Ti5 and Cu61Zr34Ti5, has been studied by nanoindentation in three different ways, including load rate control mode, load control mode, and cycles load control mode. Young's modulus of the specimen shows the dependence on loading rate when the loading rate is no more than 5 mN/s. The Young's modulus of both Cu59Zr36Ti5 and Cu61Zr34Ti5 decreases with the increasing of holding load and loading rate. But neither loading rate nor holding load has significant influence on hardness. Cyclic loading leads to slight hardening for Cu59Zr36Ti5, while Cu61Zr34Ti5 doesn't show such results. What's more, Cu61Zr34Ti5 exhibits obviously higher hardness and modulus than Cu59Zr36Ti5.",0
"Sm2O3-doped oxyfluorosilicate glasses were prepared by melt-quenching method. The differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction were carried out to investigate the glass transition temperature and structure of precursor glass. Infrared spectroscopy, Raman, optical absorption, photoluminescence and decay measurements were carried out for Sm3+-doped oxyfluorosilicate glasses. From the absorption spectrum, the JuddâOfelt intensity parameters have been evaluated to predict the radiative properties for the emission levels of Sm3+ ions. The lifetimes of 4G5/2 level are found to decrease from 1.17 to 0.93ms due to the energy transfer, when the concentration of Sm3+ ions increases from 0.1 to 2.0mol%. The optical gain parameter (18.13Ã10â25 cm2 s) of the investigated glass is found to be higher than the other Sm2O3-doped glass systems.",1
"In this study, we report a unique design of nano-porous bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoelectrode decorated with graphene linked carbon nitride (GCN) nanosheets and their potential application in solar driven photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Especially, an integrated sandwich-like heterojunction with highly interconnected porous structure, comprising two dimensional GCN sheets and three dimensional BiVO4 was successfully synthesized with significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical activity. The prepared photoelectrode achieves up to 1.98mAcmâ2 (1.23V vs RHE) under AM 1.5G solar light irradiation, 2.06 times compared with pristine BiVO4 (0.96mAcmâ2 at 1.23V vs RHE). After deposition of cobalt phosphate nanoparticles as water-oxidation electrocatalyst, a plateau photocurrent of 3.42mAcmâ2 (1.23V vs RHE) with a maximum photo-conversion efficiency of 1.28% was achieved on the prepared photoanode. The highly improved photoelectrochemical performance can be attributed to suitable band matching facilitating efficient charge separation between GCN and BiVO4 as well as the desirable incorporation of rational designed dimensionality-dependent heterojunction for promoted solar energy utilization. More importantly, the combined experimental results and computational simulations reveal that the strong donor-acceptor coupling between GCN sheets and porous BiVO4 facilitates the separation and transfer of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, accounting for the highly promoted photoelectrochemical performance.",1
"Effective blending of short length and long length fibers in concrete is termed as Graded fiber reinforced concrete. Earlier research shows that short length fibers primarily control the propagation of micro cracks, and improve the ultimate strength whereas, long length fibers arrest the macro cracks and improve the post crack deformation of concrete. Thus different combinations of short and long length fibers would help in arresting the micro and as well as macro cracks to improve both pre and post crack performances of concrete. An attempt has been made to study the effect of addition of Graded Glass Fibers with different fiber length and volume fraction in Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete. The experimental work was carried out under uni-axial tension for M30 grade of concrete with the 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4% & 0.50% fiber volume of Mono Glass Fibers (3â¯mm, 6â¯mm, 12â¯mm and 20â¯mm length fiber). In 0.3% fiber volume, different fiber volume combination of Glass fibers in Short Graded form (3â¯mmâ¯+â¯6â¯mm length fiber), combination of Glass fibers in Long Graded form (12â¯mmâ¯+â¯20â¯mm length fiber) and combination of Short Gradedâ¯+â¯Long Graded fibers to form Combined Graded fibers (3â¯mmâ¯+â¯6â¯mmâ¯+â¯12â¯mmâ¯+â¯20â¯mm length fiber) were studied. The results shows that the strength, deformation capacity and energy absorption capacity is higher for Graded Glass Fiber Reinforced concrete than Mono Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete. Graded fibers improved the workability. Fiber efficiency characteristics (Fiber length, Fiber dispersion, fiber orientation) were quantified to investigate their effect on the tensile strength of Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete (GFRC). For this purpose, optical microscopic study and an image analysis technique is used to examine the failed specimens of GFRC. The results of image analysis shows that the strength of fiber reinforced composite are dependent on the fiber efficiency characteristics.",0
"Confined self-stressing concrete (SSC) efficiently improves the crack resistance of concrete materials. Considering the drawbacks of steel bar- or fiber-reinforced SSC, we propose glassâfiber composite mesh-reinforced SSC. Some mechanical properties of mesh-reinforced SSC have been investigated, but their expansion properties remain unclear. In this research, expansion experiments were conducted to understand the expansion behavior of this new combination. The development of expansion deformation was obtained and generalized using exponential and cotangential models. Theoretical analyses of the expansion behavior were deduced from the experimental results. The analyses showed that the expansion strain increases with the increment of width confinement and decreases with the increment of longitudinal confinement. Glassâfiber composite mesh-reinforced SSC has the potential to improve the crack resistance of concrete materials.",0
"The Fe based amorphous ribbons with the nominal compositions Fe84.2â x C11.0Si x B3.9P0.9 (x =4.5 and 13.5 at.%) were oxidized at low temperatures of 300 and 400Â°C (i.e., well below the crystallization temperature) for 24h in the air atmosphere. Significantly different oxidation kinetics between surfaces of the wheel side and the air side were observed, respectively. A continuous amorphous Si oxide layer with a few nanometers in thickness was formed on the air side surface of as-spun ribbon and effectively protected the ribbon from oxidation during annealing. However, discontinuity of the amorphous Si oxide layer was observed near casting defects on the wheel side surface. Moreover, due to low cooling rate near the casting defect regions, nanocrystals can be formed resulting in enhanced oxidation kinetics of the wheel side surface. As the annealing temperature is increased to 400Â°C, the air side surface exhibited deteriorated oxidation resistance attributed to partial nanocrystallization of Î±-Fe. Nanocrystals of Î±-Fe formed on the surface acted as effective nucleation sites for the formation of iron oxides. Increasing annealing temperature leads to the increased thickness of both amorphous and crystalline oxide layers. However, effects of surface casting defects on the oxidation resistance can be significantly reduced by increasing the Si content.",0
"In this paper, thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and dynamic mechanical analysis were employed to study the properties of phenolic foam reinforced with glass fiber mat. Unreinforced phenolic foam was taken as the control sample. Mechanical tests and scanning electron microscopy were performed to confirm the results of TMA. The results show that glass fiber mat reinforcement improves the mechanical performance of phenolic foam, and nucleating agents improve it further. Phenolic foam reinforced with glass fiber mat has a smaller thermal expansion coefficient compared with unreinforced foam. The storage modulus of the reinforced phenolic foam is also higher than that in unreinforced foam, whereas the loss modulus of the former is lower than that of the latter. The glass transition temperature of the phenolic foam matrix remains unchanged during the reinforcement.",0
"Mg67Zn28Ca5 bulk metallic glass reinforced with 0.66â1.5vol% of nano alumina particulates were successfully synthesized using disintegrated melt deposition technique. Microstructural characterization revealed reasonably uniform distribution of alumina particulates in a metallic glass matrix. The reinforced particles have no significant effect on the glass forming ability of the monolithic glass matrix. Mechanical characterization under compressive loading showed improved micro hardness, fracture strength and failure strain with increase in nano alumina particulate reinforcement. The best combination of strength, hardness and ductility was observed in Mg/1.5vol% alumina composite with fracture strength of 780MPa and 2.6% failure strain.",0
"Thermal, structural and ionic conduction characteristics of lithium niobophosphate glass (mol% 50Li2Oâ45P2O5â5Nb2O5) are reported and compared with the characteristics of lithium metaphosphate glass (mol% 50Li2Oâ50P2O5). The presence of the second glass former (Nb2O5) not only improves the chemical durability and thermal stability but also enhances the conduction characteristics of lithium metaphosphate glass. The ionic conductivity measurements are reported in the extended temperature range i.e. above the glass transition temperature (Tg) where a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity has been observed. The ion conduction process below Tg is governed by a well-defined activation energy whereas the conduction process above Tg is activated by at least two different phenomena discussed in the light of the structural relaxation and crystallization.",1
"Iron-based metallic glass coatings (denoted as FeWCrNiMoBSiC) were prepared on 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel cylinders by atmospheric plasma spraying at different parameters. The morphology, microstructure, and crystalline structure of as-prepared Fe-based metallic glass coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. A Pycnometer and a Vickers hardness tester were adopted to measure the porosity and microhardness of iron-based metallic glass coatings. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry analysis was conducted to investigate the crystallization behavior of various iron-based metallic glass coatings, and a ball-on-disk tribometer was performed to evaluate the tribological properties of the coatings coupled with silicon nitride ceramic balls under unlubricated conditions. It has been found that the microhardness of iron-based metallic glass coatings increases with increasing plasma arc power, which is related to the degree of melting of feedstock powders and the compactness of as-prepared coatings. Besides, the phase compositions of as-sprayed coatings consist of amorphous structure and limited crystalline structure, and the contents of the amorphous structure and crystalline structure vary with plasma arc power. Moreover, iron-based metallic glass coatings deposited at different plasma arc powers show similar steady-state friction coefficients (0.8â0.9), but their wear rate varies with varying plasma arc power. Particularly, iron-based metallic glass coating with next to the highest hardness exhibits the best anti-wear ability, which is the outcome of the compromise between the hardness and brittle fracture as well as abrasive wear of the coatings during sliding process.",0
"The mechanism of room temperature persistent spectral hole burning was investigated using Eu-doped sodium borate glass (35Na2Oâ65B2O3). The concentrations dependence of defect centers on the extent of hole burning was investigated for several Eu concentrations because the mechanism proposed so far are of two types: electron transfer to Eu3+ from Eu2+ and from defect centers in the glass. When the defect concentration increased due to X-ray irradiation, a high-temperature hole burning was observed at a Eu concentration (0.3 mol%); where the phenomenon is not observed in a normal sample without X-ray irradiation. When the Eu concentration was very low (0.1 mol%), a spectral hole was observed only at low temperatures even when the concentration of defect centers became saturated due to X-ray irradiation. Furthermore, a concentration quenching of fluorescence from Eu3+ became obvious at Eu concentrations of more than ca. 1 mol%. Hole burning became obvious at the same concentration. These findings indicate that the mechanism is an energy transfer from selectively excited Eu3+ to adjacent Eu2+ and subsequent electron transfer from Eu2+ to Eu3+. Defect centers in the glass reduce the barrier height of this electron transfer.",1
"Glass/wool felts hybrid laminates have been manufactured by hand lay-up using an epoxy resin and subjected to tensile, flexural and falling weight impact loading up to penetration. Two configurations with glass mat skins and wool felt cores with different thickness were compared and impact behaviour of both configurations was modelled. It can be suggested that the insertion of two wool felts instead of one in the laminate core would slightly improve their tensile and impact characteristics, less so for flexural ones. However, early occurrence of pull-out and the likely presence of porosity were found to affect the performance of the laminates, especially in terms of the appearance of early damage under impact loading. On the other side, the model proved largely capable of predicting the features of impact hysteresis cycles on these structures, which presented some mechanical complexity due to the tendency of wool fibres to be highly coiled in felts.",0
"The purpose of this study is to investigate news activators in the preparation of alkali-activated materials (AAMs) alternative to Portland cements by reusing waste glass. Alkali-activated blast furnace slag (AAS) constitutes an alternative to Portland cement due to high energy and environmental pollution associated with industrial Portland cement. Moreover, alkali activated materials offer a series of higher properties than ordinary Portland cement (OPC), such as better strength and durability behaviour. However, the rheology of these materials has been much less intensely researched. The present study aimed to study the effect of waste glass as activator and as replacement of blast furnace slag on the rheological behaviour of AAS pastes, with a comparison between the rheological parameters and fluidity of these pastes to the same parameters in standard cements (CEM I and CEM III/B). The findings show that AAS paste behaviour of rheology when the activator was a commercial waterglass solution or NaOH/Na2CO3 with waste glass was similar, fit the Herschel-Bulkley model. The formation of primary C-S-H gel in both cases were confirmed. However, the rheological behaviour in standard cements fit the Bingham model. The use of the waste glass may be feasible from a rheological point of view in pastes can be used.",0
"The magnetic behavior of CoCl2Â·H2O is examined for the first time. An antiferromagnetic transition occurs at 14.0 K. Below 7 K a difference between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled susceptibilities develops, and a spin glass transition appears to occur in the 6â7 K range. For large cooling fields the time dependence of the thermoremanent magnetization below T g is stretched exponential like. Competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in the dihydrate is presumable accentuated, and randomized, on removing half the waters, leading to a spin glass.",0
"The results of the experimental analysis carried out on the glass/textile fabric reinforced hybrid composites under normal condition and sea water environments have been reported. The critical stress intensity factor, interlaminar shear strength and impact toughness have been evaluated, both in interlaminar and translaminar directions. The specimen preparation and the experimentations were carried out according to the ASTM standards. Results have revealed that the damage in hybrid composite under sea water environment is entirely different. The characterising parameters have shown changes in their magnitudes with the variation in immersion time. The nature of fracture as a function of the reinforcement volume, loading and environmental conditions has been analyzed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy. The SEM analysis has shown that the fibers pull out, matrix cracking and also the nature of crack growth is different in sea water environment. The fracture in individual fiber has also been identified.",0
"The vibrational frequencies of GeS4, GeP4, Ge2S6, GeP3, Ge3P, Ge2P2, P2S2, P3S, P4S3, Î±-P4S4, Î²-P4S4, Î±-P4S5, Î²-P4S5, P4S7, P4S9 and P4S10 are theoretically computed from the first principles. The Raman frequencies of Ge x P x S1â2x glass are obtained for x varying from 0.05 to 0.019. The computed fundamental frequencies of clusters are compared with those experimentally found. In this way, we are able to identify the vibrating clusters in the real glass. The clusters identified in the real glass are found to be Ge2P2, P4S3, Î±-P4S4, Î²-P4S4, Î²-P4S5, P4S7, P4S9, Î²-P4S5, Ge2S6, Ge3P.",1
"The deformation of some silicon nitride ceramics which consist of elongated Î²-Si3N4 grains in a fine-grained matrix containing an amorphous grain boundary phase was studied by tensile testing at elevated temperature. Superplastic elongations larger than 250% could be observed, and characteristic microstructural development during deformation was studied.",0
"A Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped silicate glass with good thermal stability is prepared by the melt-quenching method. Efficient â¼2Î¼m emission is observed under 808nm laser excitation. The infrared emission characteristics and energy transfer mechanism are investigated. To obtain efficient â¼2Î¼m emission, the optimized concentration ratio of Tm3+ to Ho3+ is found to be 0.75:0.4 in the present silicate glass system. Additionally, the energy transfer between Tm3+ and Ho3+ plays an important role in the luminescence mechanism and energy transfer efficiency from Tm3+ to Ho3+ reaches 88%. The emission property together with good thermal property indicates that Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped silicate glass is a potential kind of laser glass for efficient 2Î¼m laser.",1
"The magnetic susceptibilities of liquid Crî¸Te, Mnî¸Te and Feî¸Te alloys decrease with increasing temperature. The effective Bohr magneton numbers P obtained from the Curie-Weiss law are about 4.31, 5.53 and 4.42 for liquid CrTe, MnTe and FeTe, respectively. The large values of P suggest that the d-states of Cr, Mn and Fe ions in these liquid alloys are split into two sub bands of spin up and spin down due to the intra-atomic Coulomb interaction. The susceptibilities of liquid Tiî¸Te, Vî¸Te, Coî¸Te and Niî¸Te alloys show non-magnetic behaviour. However, those of liquid Vî¸Te and Coî¸Te alloys become magnetic on increasing the concentration of the transition metal. The density of d-states at the Fermi level can be estimated from the susceptibilities of transition metal alloys for a non-magnetic state. These results are consistent with the trend of the electrical conductivities of liquid transition metal-Te alloys.",0
The Ti-based bulk metallic glass Ti47Cu38Zr7.5Fe2.5Sn2Si1Ag2 was fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The crystalline phases in the gas-atomized powder disappear after additive manufacturing and the SLM parts are fully glassy. All SLM samples reach a high relative density above 98.5% and a high compressive strength around 1700â¯MPa despite failing prematurely in comparison with as-cast rods. Our work identifies a Ti-based glass-forming alloy suitable for laser-based additive manufacturing and opens up new vistas for overcoming the intrinsic limitations of Ti-based BMGs in terms of size and geometry and for making them accessible to (biomedical) applications.,0
"In this work, the deformation behavior of a Zr-based bulk metallic glass specimen under a tailored complex stress state was investigated. When the specially designed specimen was subjected to a uniaxial tensile loading, the in-plane stress distribution along the symmetrical plane was hyperbolic, with the presence of both compressive and tensile stresses. The evolution of deformation in the specimen was found to consist of three stages: the shear band initiation stage (stage I), the shear band multiplication stage (stage II) and the final rapid fracture stage (stage III). In a conventional tensile specimen with uniformly distributed stresses, the specimen fractures (stage III) catastrophically after stage I. However, in the specially designed specimen, the complex stress distributions result in not only more stable shearing processes in stage I, but also the evolution of stage II before stage III, which causes the formation of a large number of shear bands. The findings shed more light on the deformation mechanisms of bulk metallic glasses under complex stress states.",0
"This study explored the feasibility of preparing Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 bulk metallic glass composite with powder metallurgy. With high energy ball milling of a pure Ti, Cu, Ni, Sn and carbon nanotube (CNT) powder mixture, the CNT/Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 metallic glass composite powders can be formed with mechanical alloying (MA) after 8h milling. The bulk metallic glass composite was successfully prepared by vacuum hot pressing the as-milled CNT/Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 metallic glass composite powders. The corrosion behavior of the Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 bulk metallic glass as well as composites modified by the addition of CNT was investigated by electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical characterization was performed in Hanksâ solution at 37Â°C with physiologically relevant dissolved oxygen content. The results of potentiodynamic polarization measurements revealed that the Ti-based bulk metallic glass composites examined showed spontaneous passivity by anodic polarization with a passive current density of about 10â5 A/cm2. The higher corrosion resistance of the Ti-based bulk metallic glass composites was attributed to stable and protective passive films enriched with titanium containing certain amounts of additional elements.",0
"We present the HâT phase diagram of the cubic (K,Ba)BiO3 high T c superconductor (T câ¼30 K). We show that the vortex solid melts into a liquid phase for T>T g(H) through a second order phase transition which can be well described by the vortex-glass transition scaling laws down to the lowest temperatures. Moreover, as usually observed in other high T c materials, the `apparent' critical current deduced from the width of the magnetization loops present a non monotonic behavior (so-called `fishtail effect'). The position of the peak is time-independent at low temperature but disappears for long waiting times above â¼T c/2. This may be related to a sharp increase of the relaxation rate in the vicinity of the vortex-glass transition line.",0
"The room-temperature high-pressure effects on Ti38Zr38Ni24 metallic glass and its corresponding icosahedral quasicrystal have been investigated by in-situ angle-dispersive synchrotron radiation. It is demonstrated that the thermodynamic metastable metallic glass and icosahedral quasicrystal retain their structures up to 42.9 and 46.0GPa, respectively. For the Ti38Zr38Ni24 quasicrystal, disorders are likely developed during compression. However, no special behaviors are detected in its amorphous counterpart although thermal analyses suggest that the metallic glass is possibly in microquasicrystalline nature.",0
"The luminescence characteristics of Ce3+-doped LnâSiâAlâOâN (Ln=Sc, Y, Gd, La) glasses have been investigated. As a function of the chemical composition and in particular the cerium concentration, the emission shifts over a broad interval (380â500nm). It has been shown that the emission shift is the result of a competition between Ce3+ and the other lanthanide ions for incorporation on different sites in the glass matrix, combined with energy transfer between Ce3+ ions on the different sites.",1
"Samples of the (Mg0.585Cu0.305Y0.11)97(Zr0.35Ti0.3Be0.275Cu0.075)3 bulk metallic glass (BMG) with 3mm in diameter were successfully fabricated by copper mould casting method. The amorphous nature, thermal stability, microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloy were investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electronic testing machine. The results show that the alloy presents a fully amorphous structure containing two glassy phases caused by phase separation. The Zr-rich amorphous spherical phase is distributed in the Mg-rich glassy matrix of the as-cast sample. Under uniaxial compressive loading, the compressive fracture strength, elastic strain and plastic strain of the BMG with a diameter of 3mm are 1026MPa, 2.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The ridge form vein-like patterns and multiple shear bands are observed in the fracture surface, indicating the improvement of the mechanical properties of the alloy. The formation of phase separation and the corresponding fracture mechanism were discussed.",0
"A metallic glass matrix composite (MGMC) reinforced by copper short fibers has been prepared by warm extrusion of powders, and its deformation behavior at room temperature and in the supercooled liquid region of the metallic glass has been investigated. A mixture of Ni59Zr20Ti16Si2Sn3 metallic glass powders and copper powders is extruded in the supercooled liquid region of the metallic glass with an extrusion ratio of 5. The volume fraction of the copper phase is 0.2. After extrusion, initially spherical powders are elongated along the extrusion direction; no pores are visible. The MGMC shows a high failure strength of around 1.85 GPa, slightly lower than that of the as-cast Ni59Zr20Ti16Si2Sn3 metallic glass, under uniaxial compression. However, due to the crack bridging mechanism produced by the randomly distributed copper short fibers, the MGMC does not catastrophically fail by a single shear band propagating across the whole monolithic sample. In the supercooled liquid region of the metallic glass, the MGMC shows large elongation to failure but fails by cavitation due to the preexisting Ni-based crystalline powders.",0
"The martensitic transformation behavior and mechanical properties were investigated in a Ti-doped Ni53Mn23.5Ga18.5Ti5 alloy aged at 873K for different durations. It is shown that the volume fraction of the Ni3Ti phase increases and the Ni content in the matrix reduces with increasing aging time, resulting in the decrease of the martensitic transformation temperatures. The precipitation of Ni3Ti particles strengthens the matrix, resulting in the increasing in the fracture toughness. Fracture morphology observation shows the fracture type changing from intergranular brittleness fracture to a mixture of intergranular and transgranular ductile failure is responsible for the improved mechanical properties.",0
"Magnetic susceptibility Ï and specific heat C P measurements on Ce4Y3Ni3 are presented. The temperature of the maximum of Ï ac(T) and C P(T) shifts with frequency and applied field respectively, as expected for a spin glass (SG) system. The C P(T â 0) dependence corresponds to that of an anisotropic SG. According to the entropy gain two Ce atoms are involved in the SG contribution and two exhibit Kondo effect.",0
"The effect of grain structure on quench sensitivity of an AlâZnâMgâCuâCr alloy was investigated by hardness testing, optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The results show that with the decrease of quenching rate from 960 Â°C/s to 2 Â°C/s, the hardness after aging is decreased by about 33% for the homogenized and solution heat treated alloy (H-alloy) with large equiaxed grains and about 43% for the extruded and solution heat treated alloy (E-alloy) with elongated grains and subgrains. Cr-containing dispersoids make contribution to about 33% decrement in hardness of the H-alloy due to slow quenching; while in the E-alloy, the amount of (sub) grain boundaries is increased by about one order of magnitude, which leads to a further 10% decrement in hardness due to slow quenching and therefore higher quench sensitivity.",0
"The glass formation, microstructure and thermal stability of Mg60Cu10Ni16Nd14 bulk metallic glass (BMG) were investigated by using copper mould casting, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that at least 3mm in diameter of BMG with a larger supercooled liquid region up to 61K was obtained for the designed composition. Phase-separated regions with diameter size <2Î¼m are homogeneously distributed in the as-cast sample. Under uniaxial compressive loading, the designed Mg-based BMG demonstrates a remarkable macroscopic plastic strain of 2.5% and no work hardening behavior for the sample of 3mm in diameter at room temperature. The improvement of mechanical properties was explained by the extensive shear band formation, interaction, and multiplication due to the heterogeneous microstructure caused by the phase separation during solidification. The low yielding behavior for the BMG was suggested to come from the random formation of shear bands before reached the plateau stress.",0
"Optical absorption, thermoluminescence, infrared spectra and differential thermal analysis of three different tellurite glass systems viz., ZnF2âAs2O3âTeO2, ZnF2âBi2O3âTeO2 and ZnF2âP2O5âTeO2 containing 0.4% of Cr2O3, have been investigated. Results have been analysed in the light of different oxidation states of chromium ion and the most suitable host for lasing Cr3+ ions has been identified and reported.",1
"The initial stages of the crystallization kinetics of lithium metasilicate (LS) in glasses of the Li2OÂ·SiO2âCaOÂ·SiO2 join â which has a simple eutectic â was investigated at high undercoolings, somewhat above the glass transition temperatures. Calcium metasilicate crystals precipitate and grow only in the advanced stages of crystallization. The variation of glass composition from the eutectic (26.5mol% Li2O) towards lithium metasilicate (50mol% Li2O) results in a sharp increase of the internal nucleation rate of LS crystals, whereas the growth rates increase only weakly. This strong increase of the nucleation rate is primarily caused by a decrease of the thermodynamic barrier for nucleation â due to an increase of the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization and a decrease of the nucleus/liquid interfacial energy â as the glass composition approaches the crystal composition.",1
"Glass fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites have enticed the researchers since last few decades, due to their excellent mechanical properties and wear resistance behaviour. In this paper woven roving E-glass fiber reinforced epoxy resin composite was prepared by hand lay-up method, followed by curing at 140â¯Â°C for 6â¯h. Density, porosity and different mechanical properties, such as hardness, tensile strength and impact strength were evaluated experimentally, and the test results were compared and validated with the experimental results of open literature. Three-body dry abrasion behaviour of the composite sample was also investigated.",0
We report a series of Ni-free quaternary Zr-based bulk metallic glasses developed by substitution of Fe for Cu in ternary Zr60Cu30Al10 alloy. Addition of Fe lowers the liquidus temperature of the ternary Zr60Cu30Al10 alloy. The alloy compositions of Zr60Cu25Fe5Al10 and Zr62.5Cu22.5Fe5Al10 were found to be very near a quaternary eutectic point with low liquidus temperature. The as-cast glassy alloy rods with a diameter of 20mm were easily synthesized at Zr60Cu25Fe5Al10 and Zr62.5Cu22.5Fe5Al10 alloy compositions by copper mold casting.,0
"Introduction Le risque global de cancer chez le patient ayant eu une transplantation rÃ©nale est 3Â Ã 5Â fois supÃ©rieur Ã celui de la population gÃ©nÃ©rale et celui des Ã©pithÃ©liomas cutanÃ©s, les plus courants, est multipliÃ© par 100. Les causes de cancer post-transplantation sont multiples, impliquant des modifications de lâimmunosurveillance des cellules nÃ©oplasiques, une rÃ©activation virale ou une augmentation des infections virales, des risques gÃ©nÃ©tiques ou acquis, mais aussi les immunosuppresseurs. Observation Nous rapportons le cas dâun patient Ã¢gÃ© de 48ans, ayant reÃ§u en 2002Â le rein dâun donneur vivant apparentÃ© (sa sÅur), semi-identique. Le protocole de lâimmunosuppression est le suivantÂ : induction par et entretien par corticoÃ¯des, MMF, et cyclosporine. Ã 5ans (2009), en post-greffe, il a Ã©tÃ© atteint dâune maladie de Bowen du pÃ©nis traitÃ©e par exÃ©rÃ¨se complÃ¨te. En novembre 2013, il a consultÃ© pour une tumÃ©faction au niveau du dos. Lâexamen clinique a trouvÃ© un nodule de 2,5cm, Ã surface Ã©rosive et purulente surmontant une tumÃ©faction douloureuse de 5Ã4cm. LâÃ©chographie des parties molles a montrÃ© une formation tissulaire vascularisÃ©e par endroit avec un prolongement sous-cutanÃ©. Le patient a Ã©tÃ© opÃ©rÃ© sous anesthÃ©sie locale. Lâexamen anatomopathologique de la piÃ¨ce a montrÃ© un carcinome sÃ©bacÃ© 1,7Ã1,3cm (exÃ©rÃ¨se complÃ¨te). Une rÃ©duction de lâimmunosuppression a Ã©tÃ© faite. Discussion Le carcinome sÃ©bacÃ© extra-oculaire est une tumeur cutanÃ©e maligne rare, de diagnostic souvent difficile de par son polymorphisme clinique et histologique. Son pronostic dÃ©pend surtout de la prÃ©cocitÃ© du diagnostic. En effet, cette tumeur est agressive dans 29Â % des cas et le risque de mÃ©tastases lymphatiques et viscÃ©rales nâest pas rare. Conclusion En post-greffe, la prÃ©vention est indispensable, avec des dÃ©pistages rÃ©guliers, une protection solaire et un traitement inducteur adaptÃ© au risque. Chez les patients greffÃ©s dÃ©veloppant un cancer, une immunosuppression peut cependant Ãªtre conservÃ©e grÃ¢ce aux inhibiteurs du signal de prolifÃ©ration qui prÃ©sentent une activitÃ© antitumorale intÃ©ressante aux doses efficaces dâimmunosuppression.",0
"The present review article discusses the nature and properties of soft atomic motion modes, and their role in anomalous properties, including low-energy dynamical properties, of (nonmetallic) glasses. The basic concept and results of the soft-mode model of anomalous properties of glasses are summarized and discussed. The discussion shows that this model is able, in particular, to give a qualitative and scale description of anomalous dynamic and thermal properties of the glasses at low temperatures and frequencies. In accordance with the general suggestion of solid state theory, the âexcessâ (non-Debye) low-energy excitations are expected to determine the properties under discussion, and the major problem is the description of âexcessâ excitations. The present review is aimed at demonstrating that the soft-mode model is able to describe the nature of âexcessâ excitations at low temperatures T âª T D Â and low frequencies Î½ âª Î½ D , including both very low ( T , Î½ ) , T â² 1 K , and moderately low ( T , Î½ ) , 1 K < T < 10 2 K . In fact, an essential contribution to the properties is found to be due to soft-mode harmonic vibrational excitations at moderately low T and Î½ , e.g.,Â to the boson peak as a universal broad asymmetric peak in inelastic scattering spectra of photons or neutrons, while at very low T and Î½ to be determined by soft-mode nonvibrational excitations like two-level systems. Thus in the model the âexcessâ excitations in glasses are soft-mode excitations mainly described by one of the two simplest fundamental systems: strongly anharmonic two-level systems or harmonicÂ oscillators. In this sense an important correlation can be predicted in the model between the properties at very low ( T , Î½ ) and at moderately low ( T , Î½ ) in the glasses. This prediction naturally corresponds to a recently found empirical correlation: characteristic dynamic and thermal properties of the glasses at very low temperatures are found to be missing in amorphous materials where no boson peak is found. Additional manifestations of the soft modes in glassy phenomena are also described, which concern the origin of the so called negative-U centres in electron properties of semiconducting glasses and the predicted strong suppression of low-energy properties of glasses at moderately high hydrostatic pressure. Other models of the anomalous properties of glasses can either be considered as the limit case of soft-mode model for very low ( T , Î½ ) or as relevant for only moderately low ( T , Î½ ) (while not being in terms of soft modes).",0
"BaTiO3 films have been deposited on ITO coated glass by solâgel method using barium acetate and titanium butoxide as starting materials. The optical properties were studied by UVâVISâNIR spectroscopy and the results indicated that the films had high transparency in the visible spectral zone. From the UVâVIS absorption data, the band gaps of the films were determined to be in the range of 3.72â3.77eV, depending on the annealing temperature and time. Electrical measurements revealed that dielectric constants of the films increased with the increase of annealing time and temperature and reached a value of 180, but the breakdown voltage decreased from 100Ã106 to 12.5Ã106 Vmâ1 at the same time.",1
"It is significant for designers to consider not only short-term characteristics but also the long-term properties of composite materials that are commonly used in highway bridge applications. In this study, flexural tests were performed on composite specimens that were exposed to both fresh water and artificial seawater environments at 40Â°C, 60Â°C and 80Â°C temperatures. The purpose of conducting these tests is to (1) investigate the hygrothermal aging effects on flexural properties of pultruded fiber reinforced polymer (PFRP) composites, and (2) to establish relationship between flexural strength and flexural modulus and hygrothermal aging time. Based on the results of this study, it was found that: (i) the degradation in both average flexural strength and modulus increases at higher temperatures; (ii) the degradation in transverse flexural strength and modulus is relatively higher as compared to those observed for longitudinal flexural strength and modulus; and (iii) the reduction in average flexural strength and modulus for specimens exposed to fresh water and artificial seawater environments is relatively small. The long-term hygrothermal aging effects on flexural properties of PFRP laminates, including temperature variation during exposure, were predicted using both Phillips equation and Arrhenius relationship. The predicted flexural strength, flexural modulus and coefficient âAâ agreed well with experimental results. The hygrothermal aging effects on flexural properties, at room temperature (23Â°C) after 100.0years, were predicted and compared with design values prescribed by ACI-440, TR-55 and GB50608 design guidelines provisions. Results of this study confirmed the reliability of design values recommended by ACI-440 design guidelines that were found to be similar to experimental results, while design values produced by following procedures recommended by both TR-55 and GB 50608 documents are about 1.75â2.25 times larger than the predicted values.",1
"Tb3+-doped silica glass was prepared as a luminescent material by impregnation of 0.1M TbCl3 solution into a porous silica glass followed by high temperature sintering in a CO reducing atmosphere. Under the 225nm UV and X-ray excitations the intense violet-blue Tb3+ luminescence from 5D3 level is observed, comparable in intensity to the green emission starting from the 5D4 level. Luminescence decay times of 1.18 and 2.18ms are obtained, respectively, for the emission transitions starting from 5D3 and 5D4 levels. Relative concentration of Tb ions participating in cross-relaxation process is estimated. The integral scintillation efficiency obtained for this Tb3+-doped silica glass under X-ray excitation is of about 104% of that of the reference Bi4Ge3O12 scintillation crystal.",1
"In this study, stiff stab-resistant materials for riot shields were developed by using fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPs) made of three different types of fibers: carbon, glass and p-aramid. The stab resistance of the FRPs were investigated with respect to the thickness and types of reinforced fibers according to the U.S.A. National Institute of Justice (NIJ) standard. Hybrid composites were then developed to compensate for the weaknesses of each FRP, and the stacking sequences were optimized. The mechanisms of the stab resistance and the blade penetration for each FRP were investigated via static stab compressive tests. Additionally, the failure mode and fracture topography after the stab resistance tests were obtained using a micro-CT scanner.",0
"Glass fiber (GF) reinforced phenolphthalein-based polyarylene ether nitrile composites were prepared through melt blending, and the composites were characterized by various methods to find that both the mechanical and thermal properties of the silane coupling agent treated GF reinforced composites were improved with the increase of GF content. Tensile strength, flexural strength and Izod impact strength got their highest values with GF content at 35Â wt.%, 30Â wt.% and 25Â wt.% respectively. The heat distortion temperature (HDT) of 30Â wt.% GF reinforced composite is 284Â Â°C, more than a 100Â Â°C increase compared to the pristine resin.",0
"A kind of bismuth-doped silica glasses have been produced successfully by spark plasma sintering at 1070â¯Â°C using bismuth-doped SBA-15 powders. The samples were detected by X-ray diffraction, UVâvisâNIR, photoluminescence, fluorescent decay curve and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that the samples possess favorable near-infrared fluorescence and the 0.9â¯mol% sample is the best one among these glasses. The emission peaks at ~1180, ~1150 and ~1250â¯nm can be observed when excited by 500, 700 and 800â¯nm. The average lifetimes of 0.9â¯mol% under 500, 700 and 800â¯nm excitation are 189.87, 311.46 and 132.16 Î¼s. Furthermore, the value of the important optical parameter ÏemÏ is 5.79â¯Ãâ¯10â24 cm2s at 800â¯nm excitations, which is 36.8% and 9.2% larger than bismuth-doped germanate glasses and phosphate glasses that have been reported. These emission peaks could be decomposed into three bands at ~1150, ~1240 and ~1440â¯nm via Gaussian decomposition. Based on the results of this work, it is concluded that the NIR emission peaks at ~1150, ~1240 and ~1440â¯nm correspond to Bi0, Bi+ and (Bi2)2-, respectively. This glass with excellent luminescence properties could offer a practical material to improve the performance of broadband fiber amplifiers and tunable lasers.",1
"The development of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with both high critical casting thickness and ductility is a great challenge. In this study we show that the glass-forming ability (GFA) of ductile Zr-rich ZrâCuâAl BMGs can be increased by processing the alloys under hydrogen-containing atmosphere. After considering various reasons for this GFA enhancement, we attribute it to hydrogen microalloying, which generates a higher packing density. We also discuss the role of applied hydrogen pressure and present implications for future alloy design.",0
"Er3+-doped lead phosphate glasses (PKAPbNEr) were prepared by a melt quenching technique and their spectroscopic properties were investigated for 1.54Â Î¼m fiber amplifier applications. Judd-Ofelt (JO) analysis was carried out from the absorption spectra of 1.0Â mol% Er2O3-doped glass and the derived JO parameters were found to be Î©2Â =Â 4.7, Î©4Â =Â 0.7 and Î©6Â =Â 1.2 (Ã10â20Â cm2). The transition probabilities, branching ratios and radiative lifetimes for several excited states of Er3+ were predicted using JO parameters and refractive index. The stimulated emission-cross section of the green emission (4S3/2Â âÂ 4I15/2) has been determined to be 3.31Â ÃÂ 10â21Â cm2. Absorption cross-section (Ïabs(Î»)), emission cross-section (Ïemi(Î»)) and gain bandwidth (FWHMÂ ÃÂ Ïemi(Î»)) of 4I13/2Â âÂ 4I15/2 transition at 1.54Â Î¼m were deduced from the McCumber theory and found to be 4.97Â ÃÂ 10â21, 6.63Â ÃÂ 10â21 and 267Â ÃÂ 10â28 (cm2), respectively. The decay curves exhibit single exponential nature and the lifetimes were determined to be 4.50, 4.57, 2.61, 2.06, 1.48 and 1.04Â ms for 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0Â mol %, respectively, for Er2O3-doped lead phosphate glasses. The results confirm that the present Er3+-doped lead phosphate glasses could be considered as promising candidates as gain media for photonic applications.",1

"The plastic deformation of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 (numbers indicate at.%) bulk metallic glass (BMG) was conducted in the supercooled liquid region under uniaxial tension with various strain rates ranging from 8.3Ã10â4 to 2Ã10â2 sâ1. It was found that the deformation behavior of the BMG is strongly dependent on strain rate. Thermal and structural investigations revealed that the plastic deformation reduced the thermal stability of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 BMG and promoted crystallization or reordering of the amorphous structure. To clarify the correlation between strain and structure of the BMG, the sample that was deformed at a high strain rate and exhibited significant necking was selected for a detailed investigation of its structure in different parts (e.g., the tip, middle and end parts) by conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was found that a band crystalline structure with a strongly crystallographic orientation was formed at the tip part, while inhomogeneous nanocrystallization occurred in the middle parts, and the amorphous structure remained almost unchanged in the end part. The different structures observed in different parts of the deformed sample are attributed to the inhomogeneous deformation of the BMG at high strain rates.",0
"The ac linear (Ï 0) and nonlinear (Ï 2) susceptibilities of ferromagnetic cobalt fine particles (which were precipitated in a Cu97Co3 alloy) and of a spin-glass Au96Fe4 alloy have been measured and analyzed based on the Wohlfarth superparamagnetic blocking model with no interaction between the particles. The linear susceptibility Ï 0 of Cu97Co3 exhibits the spin-glass-like behavior, and Ï 2 has a broad negative peak at low temperature and is proportional to Tâ3 at high temperatures. The blocking model reproduced the features of observed Ï 0 and Ï 2 in Cu97Co3. On the other hand, Ï 2 of Au96Fe4 has a sharp negative peak at the transition temperature. The behavior of Ï 2 in Au96Fe4 cannot be explained by the blocking model. It is concluded that Ï 2 gives the key to clarify the difference between the spin-glass transition and the progressive freezing of the particle moments.",0
"A Zr50Cu40Al10 bulk metallic glass was deformed by three-point bending fatigue experiments. Shear bands/cracks appeared on the tensile and compressive regions of the sample surfaces. Characterizations of these shear bands/cracks cross sections by transmission electron microscopy reveal that a composition change occurred within the shear bands/cracks. Additionally, nanocrystallites with a higher copper content formed within the cracks. The composition change of the shear bands/cracks and formation of nanocrystallites are attributed to the diffusion of oxygen and copper atoms, respectively.",0
"Dy3+-doped glass-ceramics containing NaCaPO4 crystals were successfully fabricated by heat treatment at base glass, and the luminescence properties were investigated for potential applications in radiation measurements. The photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra exhibit transitions related to Dy3+ ions corresponding to the strongest excitation and emission wavelengths at 351 and 575Â nm, respectively. The CW-OSL properties as a function of dopant concentration, pre-heating temperature, pre-heating time and signal fading were investigated. The most appropriate Dy3+ ion concentration was found to be 0.25Â mol%. The TL glow curves have a broad peak feature peaking at 195Â Â±Â 5Â Â°C. The fading of the OSL signal would keep stable in five days with the intensity value of about 76.11%. The samples also exhibit good signal reusability and a broad linear dose response range (0.02â1000Â Gy).",1
"The temperature dependence of the low-field magnetization and of MÃ¶ssbauer spectra has been observed for a high-Fe-concentrated fcc Cu0.74Fe0.26 alloy. At low temperatures, the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization show different thermomagnetic behaviour. The average hyperfine field was found to increase with decreasing temperature below the Curie-temperature T c of about 240 K. An additional increase is observed below the freezing (âspin-cantingâ) temperature T f of about 40 K. In MÃ¶ssbauer spectra measured in longitudinal external magnetic fields, the second and fifth lines of the sextet (i.e. the Îm = 0-nuclear transitions) appear below T f, while they disappear above T f. These results indicate that the present alloy is a reentrant spin-glass system, characterized by freezing of transverse spin components below T f.",0
"In this paper, we investigated the characteristics of a structured copper (Cu) film deposited on the surface of an insulating epoxy glass (EG) substrate via a facile electroless plating process. The film produced by this method was found to be of high purity and has a homogeneous microstructure consisting of an assembly of numerous aggregates that vary in size from 1 to 5â¯Âµm depending on the electroless deposition time. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared electrode was investigated for the electrooxidation of formaldehyde using cyclic voltammetry in 0.1â¯M NaOH solution. Results show that formaldehyde oxidation takes place at a low potential of â0.34â¯V with large anodic current densities.",0
"Eu-doped ZnO (EZO) thin films were prepared on glass substrates at various growth temperatures by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The properties of deposited thin films showed a significant dependence on the growth temperature. The preferential growth orientation of all the thin films was occurred along the ZnO (002) plane. The maximum crystallite size and the minimum average transmittance in the wavelength range of 450â1100Â nm were observed for the EZO thin film deposited at 25Â Â°C. A red shift of the optical band gap was observed in the growth temperature range of 25â300Â Â°C. The highest figure of merit, an index for evaluating the performance of transparent conducting thin films, was obtained at 200Â Â°C of growth temperature. These results indicated that the high-quality EZO film was obtained at a growth temperature of 200Â Â°C.",0
"Prealloyed (La0.55Al0.25Cu0.10Ni0.05Co0.05)100âx Fe x (x=0, 2, 5, 8) fragments and mixtures of the Fe-free alloy together with tungsten or tantalum particles were used as starting materials for high-energy ball milling. Structure feature of the as-milled products was characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Mechanical milling of the La55Al25Cu10Ni5Co5 alloy results in the formation of glassy alloy with a wide supercooled liquid region (ÎTx ) about 76K. With iron addition, the ÎTx value of the glassy alloys is extended up to 92K for the alloy at x=8. The ball-milled La55Al25Cu10Ni5Co5 alloy with tungsten or tantalum addition formed the composites in which the tungsten or tantalum particles dispersed in the La-based glassy alloy matrix. The partial dissolution of the tungsten and tantalum in the matrix alloys improved the thermal stability of the glassy alloys. The largest ÎTx value reaches to about 92K for the composite with 30vol.% W particles.",0
"The mechanical properties and deformation behavior of Ti-based metallic glassy composites (MGCs) consisting of a glassy matrix and reinforcing dendrites of body-centered-cubic structure were investigated in the supercooled liquid region at various strain rates. Experimental results show that the yield strength of MGCs increases with the increase of the size and volume fraction of the dendrite, the increase of strain rate, or/and the decrease of temperature. Moreover, the MGCs exhibit not only homogeneous deformation characters of the glassy matrix but also work-hardening of the crystalline dendrite phase. The strain rate sensitivity and strain hardening exponent are employed to analyze quantitatively the roles of the constituents in influencing the deformation and performance during uniform deformation. The deformation mechanism is dependent of different deformation stages, which related with high density dislocations within the dendrite phase, good homogeneous flow of glassy matrix and well interface.",0
"Composites are efficient to deal with tensile loads than metals. Now-a-days, metals are replaced with composites owing to their higher strength to weight ratio and are extensively used in aircraft wing and fuselage structures. These structures are subjected to high strain rates during impact loadings, such as bird hit or run-way debris impact. In order to design robust composite structures, it is important to understand the strain-rate-dependent behavior of composite materials. In this study, influence of strain rate on the tensile properties of glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy and hybrid (glass-carbon/epoxy) composites are experimentally and theoretically investigated in the range of strain rates from 0.0016Â sâ1 to 542Â sâ1. Drop mass setup is used for high strain rate tests. Quasi-static tests are performed on Instron universal testing machine in accordance with ASTM D638. The results indicate that the tensile strength and tensile modulus of GFRP and hybrid composites increase and percentage of failure strain for GFRP, CFRP and Hybrid composites decreases with the increase in strain rate, whereas tensile strength and tensile modulus of CFRP composites remains approximately constant. The scanning electron microscopy is used for analyzing the failure modes of the failed region (surface) of the tested specimens. Non contact DIC system is used to capture the strain field with the help of high speed camera.",0

"The effect of mean stress on the fatigue strength of short E-glass fiber reinforced polyamide-6,6 composite has been investigated in this paper. Stress controlled fatigue tests were conducted in the tensionâtension cycling mode and the mean stress was varied by varying the ratio of the minimum stress to the maximum stress. Creep was observed during the fatigue process. A modified Gerber equation seems to describe the effect of mean stress on the fatigue strength of this composite. In this modified Gerber equation, creep rupture strength was used along the mean stress axis instead of tensile strength.",0
"Upconversion of 800 nm excitation in erbium doped fluoride glasses results in a strong green emission and a weak red emission. The origin of the red emission is elucidated. For fluoride glasses with an erbium concentration up to about 1 mol% it originates from the nonradiative relaxation of the green emitting 4S 3 2 level to the red emitting 4F 9 2 level. This results in a quadratic dependence of the red emission intensity on the excitation power, P ex. For glasses with an erbium concentration higher than 1 mol% the population of the red emitting level is mainly due to a cross-relaxation process between two erbium ions; one in the 4S 3 2 and the other in the 4I 9 2 state. In this case the red emission intensity depends on (P ex ) 3 2 .",1
"In this work, we present a technology for fabrication of nanochannels created in glass with which bio-analysis can be performed in combination with fluorescence microscopy. The technology is based on a glass-to-glass anodic bonding process. In the bonding process, an intermediate layer (thin insulating film) is deposited on one of the two glass wafers. The channel is then defined, with one or two photo-patterning steps, in the intermediate layer. In our approach, a 33nm thick amorphous silicon layer deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) was used as an intermediate layer. The depth of the channel is defined during the etching of this layer.",0
"A spectroscopy investigation of Ce3+ and Tb3+ ions in sodiumâzincâaluminosilicate glasses is performed using the photoluminescence technique. Blueâwhite light, with x =0.24 and y =0.24 CIE chromaticity coordinates, is obtained for the Tb3+ singly-doped glass excited at 351nm. When the sodiumâzincâaluminosilicate glass is co-doped with Ce3+ and Tb3+ a non-radiative energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3+ ions is observed upon 320nm excitation. From an analysis of the cerium emission decay curve, the Ce3+ âTb3+ energy transfer microscopic parameter and efficiency are obtained. Different concentrations of Ce3+ and Tb3+ ions in the glass host gives rise to blue and blueâgreen emissions, with different CIE coordinates. Optical waveguides were produced in the samples by Ag+âNa+ ion-exchange, and their characterization is presented.",1
"Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates are used extensively in naval ships at risk from underwater explosive blasts. This chapter presents an experimental investigation to determine the effect of dynamic loading from underwater shock waves on damage to GFRP laminates. Two types of GFRP laminates were studied with a relatively low (29%) or high (41%) volume content of E-glass fibers, representative of naval materials made using two manufacturing processes. The GFRP laminates were subjected to shock waves of increasing intensity by increasing the mass and/or reducing the standoff distance of the explosive charge. Blast damage to the laminates initiated with fiberâmatrix interfacial cracking and matrix cracking, although a higher shock wave pressure was required to initiate this damage in the composite with the higher fiber content. Blast loading also caused the initiation and growth of delamination cracks; and again the laminate with the higher fiber content displayed superior damage resistance. The laminates eventually ruptured due to fracture of the glass fibers and plies, with the composite with the higher fiber content requiring a greater shock wave pressure to cause complete fracture. Due to the superior blast damage resistance of the laminate with the higher fiber content, the postblast mechanical properties were higher than the composite with the low fiber content.",0
"The oxidation behavior of a Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 bulk metallic glass (TC4-BMG) was studied over the temperature range of 400â500Â°C in dry air. The oxidation kinetics generally followed the parabolic-rate law, and the oxidation rates increased with increasing temperature. The scales formed on the TC4-BMG consisted mostly of TiO2 (rutile structure) intermixed with small amounts of CuO particles. It was found that the scaling rate of the amorphous alloy was slightly faster than that of the crystalline counterpart. The amorphous substrate transferred into the three crystalline phases of Ti3Sn, Ti3Cu4, and Ti(Ni,Cu) during the oxidation at 400â500Â°C, indicating the occurrence of phase transformation.",0
"The study described is a part of a large-scale experimental and theoretical programme on the application of fibre reinforced plastic (frp) reinforcement for concrete structures initiated at the UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke (Sherbrooke, Canada). The programme is being carried out to gain an insight into the flexural behaviour of concrete beams reinforced with glass fibre reinforced plastic (gfrp) rebars. Results of experimental study on 3.3 m long beams reinforced with two different types of gfrp rebars are presented and compared to that of conventional steel reinforced concrete beams. Three series of reinforced concrete beams were tested in flexure. The beams were 200 mm wide and respectively 300, 450 and 550 mm high.

"In situ synthesis of 20vol% TiCâNi composites using the medium frequency induction meltingâcasting technology was investigated. The final product was composed of TiC and Ni. As the only second phase, TiC particles were homogeneously distributed in the matrix with two kinds of morphologies, i.e. large cubic and fine fibrous. It is identified that the cubic TiC is a primary phase, while the fibrous is a eutectic phase. During the reaction process, Ni was served as diluents, Ti and C as reactants and TiC as a product. The results show it is feasible to in situ form TiC in the molten Ni. The product exhibits relatively high hardness (450 HV0.5, 41.5HRC), moderate yield strength (Ï 0.2 385Â±3MPa), and high ultimate tensile strength (Ï b 591Â±5MPa), as well as good transverse flexural strength (1362Â±12MPa).",0
The orthogonalized linear combination of atomic orbitals method is used to study the electronic structure of Pd41Zr59 glass. The glass structure is simulated by 39 atoms (Pd16Zr23) randomly packed and relaxed in a cube with periodic boundary conditions. The glass potential is obtained from atomic potentials which are fitted in the XÎ± approximation to the self-consistent band structure calculations of elemental metals. The calculated density of states (DOS) is in very good agreement with the photoemission data on Pd35Zr65. The DOS at the Fermi level (0.8 states/eV-atom) is similar to the experimental result for Cu40Zr60 (0.867 states/eV-atom).,0
"Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and optical absorption spectra of Cu2+ ions in sodiumâlead borophosphate glasses doped with different concentrations of Cu2+ ions have been studied. EPR spectra of all the glass samples exhibit resonance signals characteristic of Cu2+ ions. The values of spin-Hamiltonian parameters indicate that the Cu2+ ions in sodiumâlead borophosphate glasses are present in octahedral sites with tetragonal distortion. The optical absorption spectra of all the glass samples show a single broad band, which has been assigned to the 2B1gâ2B2g transition of Cu2+ ions. The optical band gap energy (E opt ) and Urbach energy (ÎE) are calculated from their ultraviolet absorption edges. The emission bands observed in the ultraviolet and blue region are attributed to 3d94sâ3d10 triplet transition in Cu+ ion. The FT-IR spectra show that the glass system contains BO3, BO4 and PO4 structural units.",1
"To prevent carbon/carbon (C/C) composites from oxidation, a self-sealing multilayer oxidation resistant coating including a C/SiC gradient inner layer, a Si-Mo-B middle layer and a glass exterior layer was prepared by pack cementation and slurry method. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to analyze the microstructure and phase composition of the as-prepared coating. The isothermal and thermal shock oxidation resistance of the coating was also investigated. The results showed that the multilayer coating exhibited excellent oxidation resistance from room temperature to 1873K. It could effectively protect C/C composites for 100h at 1173K and 150h at 1873K, and endure 40 thermal cycles between 1873K and room temperature. The excellent oxidation and thermal shock resistance could be attributed to the gradient structure and the self-sealing property of the multilayer coating.",0
"The effect of annealing treatment on mechanical properties has been investigated for a Ti-based bulk metallic glass (BMG). A series of compression tests as well as Vickers hardness tests has thus been performed at room temperature for the BMG specimens annealed in an Ar atmosphere at several temperatures near the glass transition temperature (Tg). The ductility under compression was found to increase up to about 42% without reducing the maximum strength, but with higher hardness values. Thermal properties were also analyzed by using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while microstructures of annealed specimens were studied through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and also a high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).",0
"Triple-axis neutron scattering measurements on ZnCl2 glass are described. The inelastic scattering S(Q, Ï) for constant Q scans shows a pronounced low-frequency excitation feature in the region 0.2 to 0.7 THz in the glassy and supercooled liquid states, which can be identified with the boson peak that has been observed in other systems. Detailed results show that this feature has the temperature dependence of harmonic vibrations, in particular its frequency is independent of the temperature. Further it shows no dispersion in Q, and the intensity is strongly correlated with the static structure factor S(Q).",0
"We have measured the a.c. magnetic susceptibility of the CdCr2Ã0.85In2Ã0.15S4 insulating spin-glass over the 1 Hz-100 kHz fre for several values of an additional static magnetic field. Characteristic temperatures TÆ(H, Ï) are obtained, and analyzed in a dynamic scaling approach. Although compatible with T c = 0, our results favour a transition at Tc â 16.7 with zv â 7. The determination of the scaling function yields Î²+Î³â 3.5.",0
"Zr-based bulk metallic glasses represent an emerging important class of structural materials with interesting properties due to its amorphous nature. In this study, the structural and microstructural transformations to the heat-affected zone of a Zr-based bulk metallic glass welded by the resistance upset technology were investigated. X-ray diffraction, optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the base metal and the heat-affected zone. Vickers microhardness testing was performed to assess the mechanical response of the welded joints. The amorphous phase volume fraction measured along the welded joints shows no difference between the base metal and the heat-affected zone. It was possible to achieve a sound weld with no crystallization of the base metal.",0
"The Ti62Zr12V13Cu4Be9, Ti58Zr16V10Cu4Be12, Ti46Zr20V12Cu5Be17, and Ti40Zr24V12Cu5Be19 metallic glass matrix composites (MGMCs) were prepared by copper mould casting. The corrosion resistance and the pitting susceptibility of Ti-based MGMCs were tested on their cross-sectional areas in 3.5wt.% NaCl solutions by potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The composites with lower Ti contents (Ti40Zr24V12Cu5Be19 and Ti46Zr20V12Cu5Be17) exhibit a low resistance to the chloride induced pitting and local corrosion. The preferential dissolution of amorphous matrix is explained by the high chemical reactivity of beryllium element compared to that of stable dendrites and by the detected lower Ti and V contents. However, fairly good passivity was found in the composite with higher Ti contents (Ti62Zr12V13Cu4Be9). XPS measurements revealed that protective Ti-enriched oxide film was formed on the composite surface, additionally, lower content of beryllium element in amorphous matrix hinder the selective corrosion of amorphous matrix. The assessment of experimental observation leads to a proposed corrosion mechanism involving selective dissolution of amorphous matrix and chloride induced pitting process.",0
"Hybrid thermoplastic composites from wood flour and recycled glass fibers were manufactured through a two-step process involving a kinetic mixer and a compression molding machine. To evaluate the effect of recycled glass fibers, hybrid composites containing virgin glass fibers were also manufactured and tested. Mechanical properties of the composites including flexural modulus and strength, hardness as a function of temperature, screw withdrawal resistance and water absorption behavior were studied. The flexural modulus and hardness were found to increase as a function of increasing wood flour and glass fiber content, whilst the flexural strength and screw withdrawal resistance decreased as a function of increasing wood flour content, even though a positive effect of the addition of glass fibers was found. The recycled glass fibers showed comparable behavior to that of the virgin ones. A morphological analysis of hybrid composites to study the interfacial interactions was carried out by scanning electron microscopy.",0
"Optical properties of Tm3+ ions in Yb3+ doped fluorophosphate glasses containing 27mole% PbF2 have been studied. The absorption, luminescence and excitation spectra, and the decay patterns were obtained as function of temperature, TmF3 and YbF3 concentrations. For the blue emission centered at 479 nm ( 1G4â3H6 transition) the critical concentration ofTm3+ is 0.2mole% when the concentration of Yb3+ is kept constant at 20 mole%. The oscillator strengths of the transitions between J manifolds are calculated by using Judd-Ofelt theory at room temperature and were compared with the ones obtained experimentally. Radiative lifetimes of the excited states are determined and used to obtain nonradiative transition rates and the quantum yields. Unconverted emissions from the 1D2 , 1G4 and 3F4 levels were observed when the Yb3+ ions were excited with 966 nm light. An absolute upconversion efficiency for the blue (479 nm) and red (791 nm) emissions was obtained using a comparative method at room temperature. The efficiency of the 479 and 791 nm emissions was measured to be 5 Ã 10â8 and 7 Ã 10â4, respectively, for the sample containing 0.2 mole% TmF3 and 20 mole% YbF3 upon 966 nm excitation with an absorbed intensity of 20 mW cmâ2. The emission intensity and the decay time of the 1G4 level were found to be independent of temperature although the emission intensity and the decay time of 3F4 level show small temperature dependence when the desired level was directly excited. However, the upconverted emission intensity of these levels depends on temperature. This behaviour may be due to a phonon-assisted energy transfer mechanism from Yb3+ to Tm3+.",1
"Li2OâZrO2âSiO2: Ho3+ glasses mixed with Nb2O5 were prepared. Optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra of these glasses have been recorded at room temperature. The optical absorption spectra of all glasses recorded at room temperature in the wavelength region 300-2000 nm exhibited several absorption bands all from the ground state 5I8 to 5G5, 5G6, 5F1, 5F3, (5F4+5S2), 5F5, 5I5, 5I6, 5I7. The luminescence spectra of all the glasses recorded at room temperature in the visible and NIR regions exhibited the following prominent emission bands 5F3 â 5I8, 5S2 â 5I8, 5G4 â 5I6, 5K8 â 5I7, 5F5 â 5I8 , 5G5 â 5I6, 5F4 â5I7, 5G5 â 5I5, 5F2 â 5I6, 5F3 â 5I6, 5I5 â 5I8 (Visible region) and , 5I7 â 5I8 (NIR region). The luminescence spectra of Nb2O5 mixed Li2OâZrO2âSiO2 glasses (free of Ho3+ ions) have also exhibited broad emission band in the blue region. This band is attributed to radiative recombination of self-trapped excitons (STEs) localized on substitutionally positioned octahedral Nb5+ ions in the glass network. The JuddâOfelt theory was successfully applied to characterize Ho3+ spectra of all the glasses. From this theory, various radiative properties like transition probability A, branching ratio Î² r, the radiative lifetime Ï r, for 5S2 emission levels in the spectra of these glasses has been evaluated. The radiative life time for 5S2 level of Ho3+ ions has also been measured and quantum efficiencies were estimated.",1
"The effects of laser shock processing (LSP) on nano-hardness, elastic modulus and surface residual stress of FeâNi alloy were investigated. The values of nano-hardness, elastic modulus of the FeâNi alloy after LSP were measured by the nano-indentation technology, and the surface residual stress was determined by XRD with sin2 Ï method, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations of the microstructure before and after LSP were carried out. Experimental results showed that the values of the nano-hardness, elastic modulus and surface residual stress in the laser-shocked region and the laser-affected region were obviously improved compared to those in the non-shocked region. The mechanisms underlying the improved nano-hardness, elastic modulus and surface residual stress were also addressed.",0
"Three new compositional variants of the ZrâTiâBeâLTM (late transition metal) family of metallic glasses are discussed. Thermal stability, ÎT = T xâT g, was increased from 82Â°C for Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 (Viterloy 1) to 141Â°C for Zr44Ti11Cu20Be25. It is found that fracture toughness is the most distinguishing parameter characterizing the alloys in contrast to other mechanical properties. Quaternary alloys consistently had fracture toughness values exceeding 80MPam1/2, while for Vitreloy 1 K Q =48.5MPam1/2 with a large amount of scatter. Adding iron reduced the fracture toughness to 25MPam1/2.",0
"Glass compositions with formula (71.78â x)SiO2â2.63Al2O3â(2.63+ x)K2Oâ23.7Li2O (mol.%, x =0â10) and SiO2/Li2O molar ratios far beyond that of stoichiometric lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) were prepared by conventional melt-quenching technique to investigate the influence of K2O content on structural transformations and devitrification behaviour of glasses in the Li2OâSiO2 system. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of as cast non-annealed glasses revealed the presence of nanosized droplets in glassy matrices suggesting occurrence of liquidâliquid phase separation. An overall trend towards depolymerization of the silicate glass network with increasing K2O content was demonstrated by employing magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy. The distribution of structural units in the experimental glasses was estimated using 29Si MAS-NMR spectroscopy suggesting the appearance of Q 2, enhancement of Q 3 and diminishing of Q 4 groups with increasing K2O contents. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were used to assess the influence of K2O on devitrification process and formation of lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) and/or lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) crystalline phases.",1
"In this study, thick-section (16 and 40 plies) hybrid composites with a poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS) matrix were evaluated for tensile response. The hybridization of the composite was achieved by using E-glass and AS4-graphite fibers. Composites of five different AS4-graphite volume fractions (1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 and 0) and three stacking sequences ([0], [ 0 90 ]s and [0/ Â± 45 90 ]s ) have been evaluated and analysed. Theoretical predictions based on the classical laminate theory were used to analyse the experimental data. The effect of residual thermal processing stresses was incorporated in the predictions and found to be negligible. The hybrid effect in the composites was quantified by measuring the increase in the failure strains of the hybrid composites as compared to that of 100% AS4-graphite/PPS composites. Experimental results showed a distinct strain enhancement in tensile tests of 2â8% of hybrid composites. The hybrid effect is due to the crack arresting characteristics of the E-glass fibers. The hybridization of the composites resulted in changes in fracture modes from the brittle failure mode of AS4-graphite composites and confirmed the crack arresting properties of the E-glass/PPS fibers.",0
"Thermal measurements were made on indium-impregnated 5.6 nm Vycor glass at low temperatures in applied magnetic fields up to 1 Tesla. The indium lattice specific heat is enhanced relative to the bulk value, while the electronic contribution was unchanged. A slightly broadened superconducting transition with a bulk-like specific heat discontinuity indicate that the indium nanoparticles are strongly coupled. The phase diagram and size of the specific heat jump at T c (H) yield Îº â 15. A field-periodic magnetocaloric effect has also been observed which may be related to flux depinning in the superconducting network.",1
"VN alloy/Co-based composite coatings modified by Ti was prepared on a mild steel using laser cladding. The effect of Ti addition on the microstructure and wear resistance of VN alloy/Co-based coatings was investigated using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, micro hardness tester and wear tester. The results showed that TiN and VC phases were detected in the VN alloy/Co-based composite coatings after adding Ti, in addition to Î³-Co, Cr23C6 and Ï-FeV phases. Massive short rod-like dendrites, equiaxed grains and fine grains appeared in the composite coatings after adding Ti, and the cross-slip and jog of the dislocation disappeared. The microhardness of the composte coatings was increased significantly with the increase of additive Ti, and was improved by 21.6%, for 9.6wt.% Ti addition. The wear resitance of the composite coatings was firstly increased and thereafter decreased with the increase of additive Ti, and was improved by 25.9%, for 4.8wt.% Ti addition. The abrasive mechanism of the composite coatings after adding Ti was the abrasive wear. Thus, it can be concluded that adding Ti effectively promotes the formation of TiN and VC particles to improve the wear resistance of the composite coatings.",1
"SiO2 films produced by the sol-gel method were optimized with respect to their pore size and pore distribution so that these films are suitable for use as a basic material for thin-film humidity sensors. A capacitive humidity sensor is described which is distinguished by good reversibility, high sensitivity, good linearity, short response time (<10 s) and low cross-sensitivity towards other gases (SO2, CO2, NH3).",0
"The present work is focused to explore the influence of multiscale fillers (nano scale multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and micro scale Glass fibers) on the thermal degradation and dynamic mechanical properties of polypropylene (P). MWCNTs weight fraction was varied up to 5â¯wt% for a fixed glass fiber fraction of 20â¯wt% and the resultant composite was characterized using X-ray diffraction, Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy. Hybrid composites with 2â¯wt% MWCNTs presented 101% increase in the activation energy for thermal degradation compared to the base matrix. The synergism of multiscale fillers could be clearly verified by the improved storage and loss modulus of the composite with 3â¯wt% MWCNT which is related to better interfacial interaction of fillers with the matrix. The lowering of tanâ¯Î´ peak suggested the rise in entanglement density of polymer chains on the fillers and decrease in the damping behavior of the composites was observed till 3â¯wt% of MWCNTs both by experimental and theoretical model values. Beyond 3â¯wt% of MWCNTs agglomeration effects caused decline in the dynamic mechanical properties.",0
"10Al2O3â5B2O3â85SiO2âxSm2O3 glasses were prepared by the solâgel method. The emission spectra of the glasses indicate that the quench concentration of the Sm3+ ions is about 0.2mol%. The emission spectra of the glasses after high-temperature treatment with H2 gas exhibit the coexistence of the Sm3+ and Sm2+ ions. We observed the strong emission line of the Sm2+ ions and the emission band of the non-bridging oxygen hole center when the glasses were exposed to a femtosecond laser. It indicates that some Sm3+ ions were reduced to Sm2+ ions by femtosecond laser pulses and non-bridging oxygen hole centers were formed. The 5D0â7F0 emission line of the Sm2+ ions by femtosecond laser irradiation shows a red shift, compared with the emission of the Sm2+ ions by reduction with H2 gas. The strong absorption band and weak, sharp absorption lines in the range from the UV to IR come from charge transfer and the transition from the 6H5/2 state to the various excited states of the Sm3+ ions. The reduction mechanism of Sm3+ ions is discussed.",1
"Er3+-doped alkaliâbariumâbismuthâtellurite (LKBBT) and alkaliâbariumâbismuthâgallate (LKBBG) glasses with high refractive indices and low phonon energies have been designed, fabricated, characterized and compared. Intense 1.53Î¼m emissions with widely different widths in the two kinds of glasses were observed and recorded under 980nm diode laser excitation. The full-widths at half-maximum of the 1.53Î¼m emission bands in LKBBT and LKBBG glasses are 58 and 40nm, and the lifetimes of them were measured to be 3.21 and 3.97ms, respectively. The quantum efficiencies for the 4I13/2 level in both glasses are almost 100%. The 1.53Î¼m broad and narrow emissions with high spontaneous emission probabilities and large emission cross-sections indicate that Er3+-doped LKBBT and LKBBG glasses are suitable materials in developing broadband optical amplifier and infrared laser, respectively.",1
"In glasses with the compositions (100â x)(2Na2OÂ·16K2OÂ·8Al2O3Â·74SiO2)xBaF2 (with x =0 to 6), the glass transition temperature decreases with increasing BaF2-concentration. Samples with x =6 were thermally treated at temperatures in the range from 500 to 600Â°C for 5â160h. This leads to the crystallisation of BaF2. The quantity of crystalline BaF2 increases with increasing time of thermal treatment, while the mean crystallite size remains constant within the limits of error. The glass transformation temperature of partially crystallised samples increases with increasing crystallisation time and approaches a value equal to the temperature, at which the samples were treated. This is explained by the formation of a highly viscous layer enriched in SiO2 which is formed during crystallisation. This layer acts as a diffusion barrier and hinders further crystal growth.",1
"The influence of varying the CaO/MgO ratio on the structure and thermal properties of CaOâMgOâSiO2âP2O5âCaF2 glasses was studied in a series of eight glass compositions in the glass forming region of diopside (CaMgSi2O6)âfluorapatite [Ca5(PO4)3F]âwollastonite (CaSiO3) ternary system. The melt-quenched glasses were characterized for their structure by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and magic angle spinning (MAS)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Silicon is predominantly present as Q 2 (Si) species, while phosphorus tends to coordinate in orthophosphate environment. The sintering and crystallization parameters of the glasses were obtained from differential thermal analysis (DTA) while crystalline phase fractions in the sintered glassâceramics were analyzed by X-ray diffraction adjoined with Rietveld refinement. Diopside, fluorapatite, wollastonite and pseudowollastonite crystallized as the main crystalline phases in all the glassâceramics with their content varying with respect to variation in CaO/MgO ratio in glasses. The implications of structure and sintering behaviour of glasses on their bioactivity were discussed.",1
"Sandwich structures are increasingly used in high-performance engineering application because of their high specific stiffness, strength, environmental resistance and thermal insulation characteristics. However, poor fire resistance is a critical problem for the use of sandwich structures in engineering applications. In this study, a fire-retardant sandwich structure was developed using a phenolic foam filled honeycomb and carbonized phenolic matrix aramid/glass hybrid composite faces. The sandwich structure was designed to satisfy the limit of critical thermal radiation to humans. To improve the post-fire properties and fire resistance of the glass/phenolic composite, a phenolic coating and an aramid/phenolic composite layer were applied on the surface. The carbonization and impregnation of the phenolic matrix of the composite were repeated twice to eliminate the matrix cracking and delamination by fire exposure. Phenolic foam-filled honeycomb core was used to reduce the thermal conductivity and increase the stiffness and strength of the sandwich. Finally, the thermal insulation and post-fire flexural properties of the sandwich structure were estimated.",0
"The generalised vibrational density of states (GVDOS) and the total dynamic structure factor of the metallic glass Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 has been determined at room temperature using thermal neutron inelastic scattering techniques. The GVDOS has a relatively sharp maximum at 22.6 meV but shows very little structure otherwise and it extends out to rather high energies (approximately 60 meV). The total dynamic structure factor is a smoothly decaying function of energy, very similar to that of Zr54Cu40, however with a higher intensity of low energy modes. A considerable amount of these seem to be localized as their intensity-variation is surprisingly small in the region of momentum transfers covered in this experiment.",0
"Machining is an essential process for manufacturing high precision bulk metallic glass (BMG) components. It requires a fundamental understanding of the BMG chip deformation behaviors and their underlying mechanisms. In this study, chip deformation in orthogonal cutting of zirconium (Zr)-based BMG was investigated. A series of cuts was obtained to analyze morphological characteristics of chip and its related cyclic force. Further, the shear yielding stress, temperature, and strain rate during cutting were evaluated. By analyzing the separation of chip-workpiece and the fracture of chip, the formation mechanism for BMG chip was revealed. Based on the improved Atkinsâ model, the energy consumption in chip formation was calculated, and its relations to chip morphology were discussed. The results showed that BMG cutting produced serrated chip. Individual chip segment deformation involved the formation of the primary shear zone (PSZ) and the secondary shear bands (SSBs). The fracture of the PSZ was found to be responsible for chip serration, and the SSBs were involved in the enhancement of the material plasticity. During low-speed cutting, the PSZ experienced high temperature (>995 K) and high strain rate (>2400 sâ1). An increase in cutting speed or depth of cut led to the increase in the temperature and strain rate; however, reduced the shear yielding stress. The serrated chip formation is attributed to the fact that two cracks originated from the chip root and the free surface of the chip, which propagated face to face along the PSZ, eventually leading to the fracture of the PSZ. The generated serration energy accounted for the maximum cutting power during chip formation, while the elastic deformation energy within the PSZ accounted for the least. Increasing depth of cut led to an increase in generated serration energy. Increasing cutting speed resulted in significant increase in friction work at tool-chip contact interface, exacerbating chip material deformation.",0
"The supercooled liquid region ÎT x of a Cu55Zr40Al5 (numbers indicate at.%) glassy alloy increased by the addition of noble metals (Ag, Pd or Au) and the largest ÎT x reached 87K for Cu50Zr40Al5Pd5. The reduced glass transition temperature (T g/T l, where T g is the glass transition temperature and T l is the liquidus temperature) of Cu50Zr40Al5M5 (M=Ag, Pd or Au) glassy alloys is in the range from 0.60 to 0.61. The selection of the quaternary compositions enabled us to form bulk glassy alloys with diameters up to 3mm. The Vickers hardness, Young's modulus, compressive fracture strength and plastic strain are 573â594, 106â118GPa, 2050â2230MPa and 0.004â0.015, respectively, for the Cu50Zr40Al5M5 (M=Ag, Pd, Au) bulk glassy alloys. The addition of noble metals to the Cu55Zr40Al5 glassy alloy is effective for improving the corrosion resistance in 1N H2SO4 solution. A different crystallization behavior was observed for Cu55Zr40Al5 and Cu50Zr40Al5Pd5 glassy alloys.",0
"Carbon fibre reinforced composites finds diverse range of applications in the fields of automobiles, aircrafts, marine structures etc. Even though carbon fibres offer higher flexural strength, expensiveness of these fibres limits their use. This article suggests an alternative in the form of carbon/ glass fibre hybrid composites. The present article throws light on the study of flexural behavior and hardness on the specimens of glass and carbon fibre reinforced hybrid epoxy composites subjected to accelerated ageing. Four sets of laminated composites were prepared by hand layup process by adding graphite filler of 5%, 10%, 15%. Three sets of specimens with different filler content aged by boiling at different temperatures of 40 Â°C, 60 Â°C and 80 Â°C respectively with one set left unaged were subjected to shore D hardness test and flexural test. It was observed that the specimens with 5% graphite filler showed better flexural behaviour in comparison to the specimens with other filler content. Also it was observed that the flexural strength and flexural modulus decreases with increase in filler proportion and boiling temperature. However a little variation was found in the hardness of specimens with varying filler proportion and boiling temperatures.",0
Small-angle neutron-scattering measurements were performed for itinerant-electron-type helical-spin-glass reentrant magnets Cr0.83Mn0.17Ge and Cr0.81Mn0.19Ge. A picture of the spin-glass state coexisting with the helical spin ordering is discussed based on the temperature-dependent neutron-scattering intensity.,0
"We investigate by Monte Carlo simulations the simple cubic lattice with Heisenberg spins interacting via short range Â±J random bonds for different antiferromagnetic bond concentrations x. We find that for x<0.25, a transition of the para-ferromagnetic type occurs. For 0.25âª xâ©½0.5, the existence of a remanant magnetization and of a rounded peak of the specific heat together with other data support a paramagnetic-spin-glass transition at finite temperature.",0
"The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) based on TiO2 photoanode with FTO glass and TiO2 film co-treated by TiCl4 were fabricated. The effects of TiCl4 treatment on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs were investigated. TiCl4 treatment of the FTO glass resulted in the formation of a compact TiO2 thin layer on its surface, which could increase the electron collection efficiency. Meanwhile, TiCl4 treatment of the TiO2 film could fill gaps between nanoparticles in the TiO2 film, leading to better electron transfer. These advantages make the DSSC exhibit a highest conversion efficiency of 3.34% under a simulated solar irradiation with an intensity of 100mW/cm2 (1sun), increased by 38% compared with that of the untreated DSSC.",0
"Ce3+/Tb3+ co-doped transparent glass ceramics containing YPO4 nanocrystals were prepared using high temperature melting method, and their structural and luminous properties were investigated. XRD analysis and TEM images confirmed the existence of YPO4 nanocrystals in glass ceramics. The transmission spectra proved that the glass ceramics specimens still maintained a high transparency. Then the excitation and emission spectra of the Ce3+ and Tb3+ single-doped and co-doped glass and glass ceramics were discussed, which proved that the glass ceramics had better luminescent properties. Under the near ultraviolet (331 nm) excitation, the broadband emission located at 385 nm was observed which was ascribed to 5dâ2F5/2 and 2F7/2 transition of Ce3+ ions. Several characteristic sharp peaks centered at 489, 543, 578 and 620 nm originated from the 5D4 to 7F J (J=6, 5, 4, 3) of Tb3+ ions. The decay time of Tb3+ ions at 543 nm and the relevant energy levels of Ce3+ ions and Tb3+ ions illustrated the transfer process from Ce3+ ions to Tb3+ ions. The best CIE chromaticity coordinate of the glass ceramics specimen was calculated as (x=0.3201, y=0.3749), which was close to the NTSC standard values for white (x=0.333, y=0.333). All the results suggested that the YPO4-based Ce3+/Tb3+ co-doped glass ceramics could act as potential luminescent materials for white light-emitting diodes.",1
"Parameters for selective laser melting of Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5 (trade name AMZ4), allowing crack-free bulk metallic glass with low porosity, have been developed. The phase formation was found to be strongly influenced by the heating power of the laser. X-ray amorphous samples were obtained with laser power at and below 75 W. The as-processed bulk metallic glass was found to devitrify by a two-stage crystallization process within which the presence of oxygen was concluded to play an essential role. At laser powers above 75 W, the observed crystallites were found to be a cubic phase (Cu2Zr4O). The hardness and Youngâs modulus in the as-processed samples was found to increase marginally with increased fraction of the crystalline phase.",0
"Crystallization of SiO2, P2O5, Al2O3, MgO, Na2O glass was investigated by means of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal mechanical analysis (TMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and optical microscopy. This is a mixed network glass, in which [AlPO4] tetrahedra substitute for pairs of [SiO4] tetrahedra, leading to increased thermal stability and reduced crystallization ability. The extent of homogeneous bulk crystallization of the glass depends on temperature and heat-treatment time. Crystallization of SiO2î¸AlPO4 network glass is accomplished through reconstruction and depolymerization of the glass network as temperature and/or time of heat treatment are increased. The first phase to crystallize is AlPO4-high cristobalite, followed by the formation of spherulitic Mg3(PO4)2 which is grown on the AlPO4 crystals.",1
"ABSTRACT Polymer composite materials offer high strength and stiffness to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and total life cost reductions that appeal to the marine industry. The advantages of composite construction have led to their incorporation in U.S. yacht hull structures over 46 meters (150 feet) in length. In order to construct even larger hull structures, higher quality composites with lower cost production techniques need to be developed. In this study, the effect of composite hull fabrication processes on mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites is presented. Fabrication techniques investigated during this study are hand lay-up (HL), vacuum infusion (VI), and hybrid (HL + VI) processes. Mechanical property testing includes: tensile, compressive, and ignition loss sample analysis. Results demonstrate that the vacuum pressure implemented during composite fabrication has an effect on mechanical properties. The VI processed GFRP yields improved mechanical properties in tension/compression strengths and tensile modulus. The hybrid GFRP composites, however, failed in a sequential manor, due to dissimilar failure modes in the HL and VI processed sides. Fractography analysis was conducted to validate the mechanical property testing results.",0
"TiâZrâCuâPdâSn bulk glassy alloys have been synthesized by copper mold casting. The thermal properties, glass-forming ability (GFA) and mechanical properties were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and compression test. The series of bulk glassy alloys is expected to be used as biomedical materials because of the absence of toxic elements such as Ni, Al and Be. The 10mm rods with full glassy structure can be obtained for the Ti40Zr10Cu34Pd14Sn2 and Ti40Zr10Cu32Pd14Sn4 alloys by copper mold casting. The Ti40Zr10Cu36âx Pd14Sn x (x =0, 2, 4, 6) glassy alloys have a large supercooled liquid region of over 50K. The Ti40Zr10Cu34Pd14Sn2 bulk glassy alloy exhibits good plasticity of 3.5% during compressive applied load at ambient temperature in conjunction with distinct yield strain of 2.2% and high fracture strength of about 2050MPa.",0
"Hybrid composites of glass and jute fabric modified by treatment with Î³-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane (silane), isopropyl triisostearoyl titanate (titanate) and tolylene diisocyanate (tdi) were fabricated using unsaturated polyester resin (usp). An improvement in mechanical properties of laminates was observed when jute fabric was modified by titanate treatment. Better retention of mechanical properties in humid environments was observed in these laminates.",0
"The characteristic features of the absorption and photoluminescence spectra of ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) inside a silica matrix derived from a solâgel method were studied at room temperature. Compared with the bulk materials, the absorption edges of ZnSe QDs in silica gel glass were shifted to higher energies and the spectra exhibited the discrete excitonic features due to the quantum confinement effects. Besides the band-edge emission, photoluminescence at ultraviolet excitation also showed the emissions related to the higher excitonic states.",1
"Experimental evidence is presented that demonstrates how a light pulse incident upon a 1D semiconductor, PDATS, in zero field, seeds that semiconductor with charge held in a stable state, unrecombined, for times on the order of milliseconds. Application of an electric field at later time releases some of this seed charge which is measured whilst the remainder recombines. The fraction that is released is dependent on electric field in a fashion describable in terms of the Onsager model of geminate recombination in 1D. Two models for this effect are put forward and discussed. In the first a distribution of traps are available to hold the carriers for long times. The second model involves the formation of interchain excitons and coulomb glass states to hold the charge.",1
The effective spin-spin interaction mediated by phonons is considered in order to give a possible mechanism which could give rise to the spin-glass phase in insulators. The Abrikosov and Moukhin method has been applied in order to obtain the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat in five different temperature domains. The concurrence of the dipolar and spin-spin interaction given by phonons is discussed.,0
"Er3+, Yb3+ and Tm3+ codoped fluorophosphate glasses emitting blue, green and red upconversion luminescence at 970nm laser diode excitation were studied. It was shown that Tm3+ behaves as the sensitizer to Er3+ for the green upconversion luminescence through the energy transfer process: Tm3+:3H4 +Er3+:4I15/2 âEr3+:4I9/2 +Tm3+:3H6, and for the red upconversion luminescence through the energy transfer process: Tm3+:3F4 +Er3+:4I11/2 âTm3+:3H6 +Er3+:4F9/2. Moreover, Er3+ acts as quenching center for the blue upconversion luminescence of Tm3+. The sensitization of Tm3+ to Er3+ depends on the concentration of Yb3+. The intensity of blue, green and red emissions can be changed by adjusting the concentrations of the three kinds of rare earth ions. This research may provide useful information for the development of high color and spatial resolution devices and white light simulation.",1
"In order to study more widely the effect of frustration, spin ordering temperatures of partially bond ordered spin glasses are estimated by using the Monte Carlo simulations. We find that there is no spin glass ordering if the frustration parameter is larger than 0.43. Comparison with the Zernike theory is presented.",0
"The characterization of filament-wound composites of an E-glass fibre in a room-temperature-curable epoxy matrix is described. Data were obtained on the mechanical and thermal properties of three volume percentages of fibre: 60, 65 and 70 volume %. The system has unexpectedly good longitudinal mechanical properties but the transverse tensile ultimates are quite poor. The 70 volume % composite gave a longitudinal elastic modulus of 56 GN/m2 and a strength in tension of 1183 MN/m2. However, the transverse strength for this same composite averaged 6.2 MN/m2 with an ultimate strain of 0.042%. While a significant improvement in both longitudinal and transverse tensile ultimates could be obtained if consistently high quality composites could be wound, the techniques for doing so are not feasible for low cost commercial production. Batch to batch variation is quite significant and substantially alters the thermal conductivity results as well as the properties in transverse tension and in shear. Such variations should be carefully considered when designing with this composite.",0
"Magnetization-vector measurements were performed on a field-cooled Cu86Mn14 sample disk rotated in a stationary field H . Our results at 4.2 K reveal that the induced anisotropy field H K, which rotates rigidly with the sample for all H , is predominantly unidirectional but with higher-order components that are not negligible. H K continues to rotate fairly rigidly up to some threshold temperature, above which at sufficiently high H it turns irreversibly relative to the sample towards the direction of H . The threshold temperature (â10 K) is well below the spin-glass freezing point (â70 K). Comparisons are made with similar results previously obtained for field-cooled Ni75Mn25.",0
"Oxyfluorotellurite glasses doped with different concentrations of Er3+ ions have been prepared and characterized. Strong infrared fluorescence at 1.55Î¼m and efficient green and red upconversion fluorescence were observed under 975nm excitation. The half maximum of the 1.53Î¼m emission varies from 67 to 93nm with change in Er3+ ions concentration. Decay curves of this emission remain single exponential but with reduced lifetimes with increase in Er3+ ions concentration. Concentration quenching of lifetime of the 4I13/2 level has been analyzed with the theory developed by Auzel et al. [F. Auzel, F. Bonfigli, S. Gagliari, G. Baldacchini, J. Lumin. 94â95 (2001) 293] and is found to be diffusion limited. A mechanism has been proposed to explain the upconversion process.",1
"Several samples of poly(vinyl chloride) both unplasticized and plasticized with dioctyl phthalate, have been examined by differential scanning calorimetry. It was observed that, while the glass transition temperature T g decreased as expected with increasing plasticizer content, a small portion of the sample appeared to be resistant to the plasticizer. This was manifest in the appearance of a second T g corresponding to the unplasticized sample which remained unaffected by addition of plasticizer. The ageing behaviour of the samples was also examined using enthalpy relaxation measurements and it was observed that the presence of plasticizer accelerates the ageing process, probably due to the fact that there is greater mobility of the chains in the plasticized samples.",0
"Chromium-doped bismuth telluride (Bi2âxCrxTe3) diluted magnetic semiconductor nanocrystals were successfully synthesized in a glass matrix by the fusion method with nominal Cr concentrations of xâ¯=â¯0.00, 0.05, and 0.10. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the growth of nanocrystals with an average diameter of ~5.0â¯nm. Shifts in X-ray diffraction peaks with increasing x indicated substitutional inclusion of Cr ions (occupying Bi sites - CrBi) in the Bi2Te3 structure. The absorption spectra for xâ¯=â¯0.05 and 0.10 show two intense spin-allowed bands at ~425 and 635â¯nm and two minor spin-forbidden bands at ~650 and 685â¯nm. These bands were attributed to the Cr3+ d-d transitions, according to the crystal field theory. Finally, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra from the Bi2âxCrxTe3 nanocrystals displayed Cr3+ characteristics with spin 3/2 in the d3 state, thereby confirming the trivalent state of Cr ions in the Bi2Te3 structure.",1
The experiment provides a method for rapidly preparing a lamellar structure via processing a homogenous material with electropulsing. Treatments initially formed microstructure with residual ferrite along the current direction and produced the macroscopic soft and hard alternating layers after austenitization. The difference in elemental content was thought to be responsible for the observed phenomenon.,0
"Nano-crystalline dye sensitized solar cells (nc-DSSC) are promising alternative to expensive conventional solar cells. Relatively low efficiency in large size cell is also one of the factors that delayed the entry of this type cells in commercial market. Performance of large size DSSCs is always poor than small size cells because of high resistive losses associated with transparent conductive glass substrate. Here we show a simple method to reduce resistive loss, also, efficient collection of photogenerated carriers through silver grids which are prepared on both working electrode and counter electrode substrates by screen printing method in analogy to conventional silicon solar cells. For long-term stability, to protect corrosion of silver grids in electrolyte environment and to avoid charge recombination between silver grids and electrolyte, silver grids were overcoated by glass frit layer. Under simulated light (air mass 1.5, P in 1000W/m2), glass frit overcoated silver grid cell shows 4.68% over all light to energy conversion efficiency.",0
"A novel temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) technique has been applied to the measurement of the thermal properties of As x S100âx chalcogenide glasses in the glass transition region. All samples in this work have the same thermal history. The parameters glass transition temperature (T g), relaxation enthalpy (ÎH), heat capacity (C p) and change of heat capacity (ÎC p), which describe the thermal events in the glass transition region, were measured. The structurally determined parameters T g, ÎH, C p and ÎC p have extrema when the composition of As x S100âx glasses is As28.5S71.5 and As40S60. We show that As x S100âx glasses where x<25 at.% As are formed from two glass phases. From MDSC measurements, it was possible to establish the probable composition of the high temperature glass phase and, further, by using Raman spectroscopy, it was possible to correlate the MDSC results with the structure of the AsâS glasses.",1
"We have investigated the glassy behavior of a molecular crystal built up with chloroadamantane molecules. For a simple model of this molecule and a rigid fcc lattice a MD-simulation was performed from which we obtained the dynamical orientational correlators S Î» Î» â² ( q , t ) and the âselfâ correlators S Î» Î» â² ( s ) ( t ) , with Î» =(â, m), Î»â²=(ââ², mâ²). Our investigations are for the diagonal correlators Î» = Î»â². Since the lattice constant decreases with decreasing temperature which leads to an increase of the steric hindrance of the molecules, we find a strong slowing down of the relaxation. It has a high sensitivity on Î», Î»â². For most (â, m), there is a two-step relaxation process, but practically not for (â, m)=(2,1), (3,2), (4,1) and (4,3). Our results are consistent with the Î±-relaxation scaling laws predicted by mode coupling theory from which we deduce the glass transition temperature T c MD â 217 K . From a first-principle solution of the mode coupling equations we find T c MCT â 267 K . Furthermore mode coupling theory reproduces the absence of a two-step relaxation process for (â, m)=(2,1), (3,2), (4,1) and (4,3), but underestimates the critical nonergodicity parameters by about 50 per cent for all other (â, m). It is suggested that this underestimation originates from the anisotropic crystal field which is not accounted for by mode coupling theory. Our results also imply that phonons have no essential influence on the long time relaxation.",0
"In the present work, SiC ceramics was fabricated with AlN using B4C and C as sintering aids by a solid-state pressureless-sintered method. The effects of AlN contents on the densification, mechanical properties, phase compositions, and microstructure evolutions of as-obtained SiC ceramics were thoroughly investigated. AlN was found to promote further densification of the SiC ceramics due to its evaporation over 1800Â°C, transportation, and solidification in the pores resulted from SiC grain coarsening. The highest relative density of 99.65% was achieved for SiC sample with 15.0wt% AlN by the pressureless-sintered method at 2130Â°C for 1h in Ar atmosphere. Furthermore, the fracture mechanism for SiC ceramics containing AlN tended to transfer from single transgranular fracture mode to both transgranular fracture and intergranular fracture modes when the sample with 30.0wt% AlN sintered at 1900Â°C for 1h in Ar. Also, SiC ceramics with 30.0wt% AlN exhibited the highest fracture toughness of 5.23MPam1/2 when sintered at 1900Â°C.",0
"Purpose To assess the effect of acid etching (AE) and adhesive systems on the microtensile bond strength of conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC) and a nanofilled composite resin. Materials and methods Specimens of conventional GIC (RIVA, Self-cure, SDI) were prepared in a bipartite Teflon mold and randomly assigned (n=12) to G1- GIC+Single Bond 2 (SB2) (3M-ESPE); G2- GIC+Acid etching (AE) (37% phosphoric acid, Condac, FGM) + SB2; G3- GIC+Single Bond Universal (SBU) (3M-ESPE); and G4- GIC+AE+SBU. The adhesive systems and the composite (Filtek Z350XT, 3M-ESPE) were inserted into the mold. After 7 days stored in a humid environment, the specimens were sectioned into five slices (Isomet 1000, Buehler). Hourglass slices were trimmed and subjected to microtensile bond strength testing (BISCOÂ®; Schaumburg, USA) with 0.5mm/min crosshead speed. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and the Tukey test (SPSS 17.0, Î±=5%). Results The microtensile bond strength (MPa) means (standard deviation) were G1=9.46(3.79), G2=6.27(3.21), G3=9.35(3.91), and G4=10.13(3.53). G2 differed significantly from the other groups (p<0.001). G1, G3 and G4 were not significantly different from each other (p>0.05). There were 83% mixed fractures, 9.5% cohesive and 7.5% adhesive. Conclusion GIC etching promoted higher microtensile bond strength with universal adhesive than with a total-etch adhesive system. Acid etching is not necessary to enhance the universal adhesive bond strength and negatively affected the bond strength of the total-etch adhesive system. Without etching the GIC, there is no difference in microtensile bond strength between the adhesive systems.",0
"Atomic structure evolution induced by thermal relaxation is investigated in Fe80P11C9 metallic glass by a suite of techniques. The topological structure of Fe80P11C9 metallic glasses characterized by the Voronoi polyhedrons varies with relaxation proceeding. Meanwhile, the results of partial pair distribution functions and local composition distribution indicate that the degree of the chemical order for different species changes and the solvent-solute correlation significantly enhances. Moreover, the MÃ¶ssbauer spectra measurements suggest that significant element redistribution occurs during the structural relaxation. Hence, only topological structure change is insufficient to describe the structural relaxation. These results manifest that the structural relaxation can be described via heterogeneity degeneration, which is also supported by the small angle X-ray scattering measurements.",0
"The near-infrared emission properties in low-phonon (805â¯cmâ1) gallo-germanate glasses and their glass fibers co-doped with Yb3+/Ho3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+/Ho3+ have been investigated. Emission bands centered at about 2â¯Î¼m correspond to 3F4 â 3H6 (Tm3+) and/or 5I7 â 5I8 (Ho3+) transitions. The spectral widths of emission lines are relatively large and their values for glass samples co-doped with 0.7Yb2O3/0.15Ho2O3 and 0.5Yb2O3/0.4Tm2O3/0.05Ho2O3 are close to 159â¯nm and 343â¯nm, respectively. Gallo-germanate glasses characterized by broadband emission at 2â¯Î¼m have been used for fabrication of glass fibers. The effects of fibers length on their near-infrared luminescent properties have been also analyzed in details.",1
"Absorption and emission spectra of Sm3+ and Eu3+ co-doped lithium borate glass of the following composition: xSm2O3 +(100â x)[0.84H3BO3 +0.15Li2O+0.01Eu2O3], where x =0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7mol%, have been reported. The concentration of Sm3+ was varied keeping the Eu3+ concentration fixed at 0.01mol%. Optical absorption and emission spectra have been measured in the spectral range from 350 to 2400nm. The oscillator strength, JuddâOfelt intensity parameters, branching ratios and radiative transition probabilities were calculated. The obtained results are discussed and compared with other literature data for Eu3+ in various compounds.",1
"Phosphate based glasses containing simultaneously fluorine and nitrogen in significant amounts have been prepared according to a new synthesis route described in this paper. The results obtained on glass series based on a 55Li2OÂ·45P2O5 composition (mol %) allow, for the first time, the investigation of the effect of fluorine introduction on lithium phosphate and lithium phosphorous oxynitride glasses. New structural features, including the presence of an unreported fluorine site and a change in the Q2 groups/fluorinated species ratio which depends on the lithium fluoride content, were derived from 1D 19F and 31P solid state NMR essays. Distinction between pure phosphate and fluorinated phosphate groups was established using the 2D 31P{19F} CP-HETCOR experiments. The evolution of the glass structure was studied as a function of the lithium fluoride content. The study of the properties of these glasses showed an increase of the ionic conductivity and a decrease of the glass transition temperature due to the phosphate network depolymerisation when lithium fluoride is introduced in the formulation.",1
"We have measured the isothermal currentâvoltage (IâV) curves as a function of temperature T and magnetic field H up to 10 T in the case of applied magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis in an epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7âÎ´ thin film. The IâV curves for a fixed magnetic field can be well scaled by vortex-glass (VG) theory, indicating the VG transition in the film. We find the evidence that the dependence of critical current density J c on magnetic field and temperature is concerned in the VG transition. Below the VG line, J c follows an exponential-type field dependence, J câexp[âH/H 0(T)]. Meanwhile, there is an abrupt change of J c above the VG line. The temperature dependence of the critical current density above the VG line follows an exponential law, J c=J c0exp(âT/T 0). These imply that there exists distinguishable mechanisms of flux pinning above and below the VG line.",0
"For elucidation of the glass compositionâs influence on the spectroscopic properties in the chalcohalide system and the discovery of a new material for applications in mid-infrared fiber-lasers, a serial Pr3+-doped (100 âx)(0.8GeS2Â·0.2Ga2S3)xCdI2 (x =5, 10, 15 and 20) chalcohalide glasses were prepared. â¼4.6Î¼m mid-infrared fluorescence emission from Pr3+ in the sulfide glass is successfully observed at room temperature excited by a 2.01Î¼m Tm3+:YAG ceramic laser system, and the effective line-width of fluorescence band is 106â227nm. Intense compositional dependence of mid-infrared emissions is found. The radiative rates of Pr3+ ions in these glasses were calculated by using the JuddâOfelt theory.",1
"Products made of syntactic foams are replacing many conventional materials due to several desirable properties and commendable low density. To overcome its limitation in application it has been hybridized with CNT in this work to achieve multifunctional, mechanical and thermo-mechanical enhanced composites. It is found that when HGM is added to epoxy/CNT matrix compressive strength increases till 5% to a maximum value of 176MPa at 5wt% of HGM and beyond this volume of HGM strength decreases considerably. Storage modulus increases with increase in HGM volume due to increased restriction in polymer chain mobility of epoxy matrix. Microstructure images of fractured surface of the composites evident the good dispersion of HGM and CNT in the epoxy matrix. It can also be seen in SEM images that many microcracks generated are discontinuous and hence increasing the stability of composite in plastic region",0
"This paper investigates the effect of simultaneous mechanical and environmental loading on the degradation rate of pultruded Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composites. The experimental program included testing a large number of GFRP coupons, with vinylester or polyester matrices, conditioned for 1000 or 2000Â h under a wide range of sustained stresses and exposed to freshwater or saltwater at an elevated temperature of 60Â Â°C. Mechanical tests, including tensile strength and elastic modulus measurements were performed on the GFRP composites. In addition, glass transition measurements, moisture uptake measurements, scanning electron microscopy, and acoustic emission testing were performed to better understand the synergistic effect of mechanical loading and environmental conditions.",0
"This study investigates inter-metal dielectric (IMD) layer with a perhydro-polysilazane-based inorganic spin-on-glass (PSZâSOG) dielectric layer in 100Â nm node multilevel metallization technology. When the PSZâSOG film is cured in N2 ambient, the via resistance is worsened; the via resistance declines as the number of wafers in sequence increases because the SOG film tends to adsorb a large amount of moisture and forms a porous IMD film structure. However, when it is cured in O2 ambient, optimization by via adhesion degassing can minimize the slot effect and yield good via resistance. In this study, the non-etchback PSZâSOG process is integrated by using 100Â nm multilevel metallization technology without an expensive high density plasma chemical vapor deposition (HDP CVD) oxide process or modification of design rules. After the SOG curing recipe and degassing condition in the via adhesion film deposition have been optimized, the PSZâSOG exhibits excellent planarization, a dense IMD structure and good via resistance performance that is comparable with that of the traditional HDP CVD oxide process.",0
"Hybridisation of two composites has the potential of tailoring properties to reach a composite structure with advantages of both constituents where the drawbacks are lessened. The current work reports this practice for self-reinforced polypropylene (SRPP) composites and glass fibre to create an interply hybrid composite with enhanced stiffness and ductility. The effect of glass fibre volume fraction, matrix adhesion, and layup, was studied as the parameters to affect progressive failure through pseudo-ductility. Hybrids with up to 6.5% glass fibre volume fraction showed pseudo-ductile behaviour. However, matrix adhesion and layup interfered with this effect. It was found that composites with low adhesion matrix exhibited higher pseudo-yield strain, and for the laminates with an interleaved layup, the maximum glass fibre volume fraction for progressive failure increased by 100%. The impact behaviour of the composite laminates also demonstrated that brittleness of the glass fabric reduces the energy absorption capability of the laminates compared to SRPP composite of the same thickness.",0
"The CuZr-based metallic glass matrix composites (MGMCs) with different volume fractions of crystalline phases were designed by doping of nickel. Minor addition of nickel element can change the glass-forming ability of the resultant composites. Large compressive plasticity accompanied by strong work-hardening capacity was achieved in the Cu47Zr48Al4Ni1 composite with a volume fraction of crystalline phases of 33%. The excellent compressive properties were mainly attributed to the inhibition for the propagation of shear bands by the ductile crystals and deformation induced martensitic transformation of the B2-CuZr phase. However, no obvious global tensile ductility was obtained, due to the mode I fracture toughness and small plastic-zone size of glass matrix. To uncover the shear-band evolution during deformation, finite element simulation was conducted, revealing that the ductile B2 phase can tune the shear-stress distribution and consequently initiate and retard shear bands, which stimulates the multiplication of shear bands. Accordingly, the spacing of B2 CuZr particles is a vital factor dominating the plasticity of CuZr-based MGMCs, especially upon tension.",0
"New miscible blend systems comprised of poly(4-vinyl phenol) (PVPh) and a homologous series of polyesters of different CH2/CO ratios (from 4.5 to 7) was discovered. Miscibility has been confirmed using differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The PVPh/polyesters blends investigated exhibited a single composition-dependent glass transition and homogeneous phase morphology, and they similarly exhibited a cusp in the T g-composition relationships. This work further extended the range of aliphatic polyesters that are known to be miscible with PVPh. The FloryâHuggins interaction parameter (Ï 12) or energy density (B) obtained from analysis of melting point depression for PVPh/PEAz and PVPh/PHS blends are of negative values. More interestingly, the specific interactions in the PVPh/polyester blends change with the corresponding different structures in the polyester component. For the PVPh/PHS blend whose polyester constituent possesses a lower carbonyl density in the main chain (average CH2/CO ratio=7), the energy density B was found to be â1.17calcmâ3. This value is significantly lower than those for either the PVPh/PEAz (CH2/CO=4.5) blend system (B=â7.72calcmâ3). Miscibility, specific interactions, and peculiar T g-composition relationships in the blends of PVPh with selected homologous polyesters are discussed.",0
"Energy transfer probabilities and efficiencies from Bi3+ to Nd3+ were calculated from the decrease of intensities and lifetimes of Bi3+ as a function of concentration of Nd3+ and from the increase of Nd3+ luminescence as a function of Nd3+ concentration. The energy transfer rate obtained by the two methods is (3.7 Â± 0.2) Ã 106 sec â1 M â1 . Energy transfer was also measured versus concentration of Bi3+ ions by using lifetime measurements, and it was found that the transfer efficiency is maximum at 0.3 wt.% Bi3+ in the measured concentration range of Nd3+ from 0.5â1.5 wt.%. The contribution of the radiative transfer was established from the dip in the emission spectrum of Bi3+. It is suggested that the sensitization of Nd3+ luminescence by Bi3+ may increase the pumping range of the Nd3+ glass laser for mini lasers.",1
"Four Cu bearing alloys of nominal composition Zr25Ti25Cu50, Zr34Ti16Cu50, Zr25Hf25Cu50 and Ti25Hf25Cu50 have been rapidly solidified in order to produce ribbons. All the alloys become amorphous after melt-spinning. In the Zr34Ti16Cu50 alloy localized precipitation of cF24 Cu5Zr phase can be observed in the amorphous matrix. The alloys show a tendency of phase separation at the initial stages of crystallization. The difference in crystallization behavior of these alloys with Ni bearing ternary alloys can be explained by atomic size, binary heat of mixing and Mendeleev number. It has been observed that both Laves and Anti-Laves phase forming compositions are suitable for glass formation. The structures of the phases, precipitated during rapid solidification and crystallization can be viewed in terms of Bernal deltahedra and FrankÃ¢â¬âKasper polyhedra.",0
"We recently discovered that monodispersed nanobubbles/microbubbles could be generated from Shirasu-porous-glass (SPG) membranes with uniform pores in a system composed of dispersed gaseous and continuous water phases containing a surfactant. In the present study, size control of the nanobubbles generated was examined using SPG membranes with less than submicron-size pores. Air was pressurized into a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution ranging from 0.05 to 0.5wt.% flowing through a SPG membrane with a transmembrane/bubble point pressure ratio of 1.1â2.0. Under these conditions, monodispersed nanobubbles with a mean bubble diameter of 360â720nm were stably produced from membranes with mean pore diameters of 43â85nm. The mean bubble diameter was shown to be 8.6 times larger than the mean pore diameter; therefore, the nanobubble diameter could be controlled by the membrane pore size. Mean bubble diameter was barely affected by a flow velocity of 0.5â3.7msâ1 or by the surface tension between air and 0.05â0.5wt.% SDS solution.",0
"A proposed model of mixed covalent and three-center bond network provides an interconnected explanation of many of the characteristic phenomena observed in chalcogenide glasses over a broad temperature range. A detailed discussion of cluster formation, the glass transition and electronic features including the pinning of the Fermi level is given.",1
"The high temperature compression behavior of Cu40Zr44Ag8Al8 rods with 6mm in diameter was investigated and compared with the literature data. Microstructure of the as-cast rods were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscope in the composites state with microscale Al3Zr particles embedded in the amorphous matrix. Deformation results show that the stressâstrain behaviors of the bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) are strain rate and temperature dependent. In addition, SEM observations reveal that the initially spherical and randomly distributed microscale particles in the amorphous matrix deform to concave polygon in shape and align perpendicular to the load direction during the compression. Meanwhile nano-crystals precipitate continuously from the matrix and aggregate during deformation. Rheological analysis show that the BMGCs exhibit a transition from Newtonian to non-Newtonian in flow behavior dependent on the stain rate. Particles in the amorphous matrix have reinforcement effect on the BMGCs, but the deformation behavior is still dominated by the homogeneous flow of the amorphous matrix phase.",0
"Tungstenâtellurite glass with molar composition of 60TeO2â30WO3â10Na2O has been investigated for developing planar broadband waveguide amplifier application. Spectroscopic properties and thermal stability of Er3+-doped tungstenâtellurite glass have been discussed. The results show that the introduction of WO3 increases significantly the glass transition temperature and the maximum phonon energy. Er3+-doped tungstenâtellurite glass exhibits high glass transition temperature (377Â°C), large emission cross-section (0.91Ã10â20 cm2) at 1532nm and broad full width at half maximum (FWHM), which make it preferable for broadband Er3+-doped waveguide amplifier application.",1
"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were grown successfully onto a glass substrate using thermal chemical vapor deposition (TCVD) with C2H2 gas at 700Â°C. The synthesized CNTs exhibited good crystallinity and a vertically aligned morphology. The vertically aligned CNTs (VACNTs) were patterned with a honeycomb configuration using photolithography and characterized using field emission (FE) applications. Owing to the electric field concentration, the FE current density of VACNTs with honeycomb configuration was higher than that of the un-patterned VACNTs. Ti was coated onto the VACNT surface utilizing the relatively lower work function property to enhance the FE current density. The FE current density reached up to 7.0mA/cm2 at an applied electric field of 2.5V/Î¼m. A fluorescent screen was monitored to demonstrate uniform FE VACNTs with a honeycomb configuration. The designed field emitter provided an admirable example for FE applications.",0
We have used the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) to investigate the modifications of the cluster-glass transitions detected at temperatures above the ferromagnetic ground state in some representative CeNi 1 - x Cu x compositions ( 0.2 â©½ x â©½ 0.6 ) . The MCE was calculated from heat-capacity data measured in fields up to 90kOe and temperature down to 500mK. The observed evolution of MCE along the series is discussed considering hybridization effects.,0
Brillouin scattering results on the structural relaxation in fragile glass-forming propylene carbonate are presented. A new analyzing technique has been employed in which the full shape of the Brillouin spectrum was compared with a general hydrodynamic theory that has been modified to include non-exponential relaxation. The relaxation is found to be considerably stretched and time-temperature scaling is obeyed. This is by contrast with the reported crossover towards exponentially decay at high frequencies/high temperatures which has been observed previously with Brillouin scattering in other fragile systems such as glass-forming ionic liquids and ionic aqueous solutions. Such a crossover is also expected at sufficiently high temperatures both in mode-coupling and recent geometric phase-space percolation theories. It is concluded that there is no simple relatition between the non-exponentiality of the relaxation and the degree of fragility as has been suggested.,0
"Fully bioresorbable phosphate based glass fibre reinforced polycaprolactone (PCL/PGF) composites are potentially excellent candidates to address current issues experienced with use of metal implants for hard tissue repair, such as stress shielding effects. It is therefore essential to investigate these materials under representative loading cases and to understand their fatigue behaviour (wet and dry) in order to predict their lifetime in service and their likely mechanisms of failure. This paper investigated the dry and wet flexural fatigue behaviour of PCL/PGF composites with 35% and 50% fibre volume fraction (Vf). Significantly longer flexural fatigue life (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and superior fatigue damage resistance were observed for In-situ Polymerised (ISP) composites as compared to the Laminate Stacking (LS) composites in both dry and wet conditions, indicating that the ISP promoted considerably stronger interfacial bonding than the LS. Immersion in fluid (wet) during the flexural fatigue tests resulted in significant reduction (pÂ <Â 0.0001) in the composites fatigue life, earlier onset of fatigue damage and faster damage propagation. Regardless of testing conditions, increasing fibre content led to shorter fatigue life for the PCL/PGF composites. Meanwhile, immersion in degradation media caused softening of both LS and ISP composites during the fatigue tests, which led to a more ductile failure mode. Among all the composites that were investigated, ISP35 (35% Vf) composites maintained at least 50% of their initial stiffness at the end of fatigue tests in both conditions, which is comparable to the flexural properties of human cortical bones. Consequently, ISP composites with 35% Vf maintained at least 50% of its flexural properties after the fatigue failure, which the mechanical retentions were well matched with the properties of human cortical bones.",0
"In this experimental work, we studied the mechanical behaviour of a short glass fibre reinforced polyamide frequently used in the automobile industry. In order to investigate the influence of glass fibre content, temperature and strain rate, we carried out a series of uniaxial tensile loadings on an unfilled polyamide and glass fibre reinforced polyamide with different weight fractions: 15, 30 and 50wt%. Experimental results showed that the studied composite is a strain rate, temperature and fibre volume fraction dependant material. Both elastic modulus and tensile strength increase with strain rate and decrease with temperature. Glass fibre reinforced PA66 exhibits improvement in its mechanical strength. The evolution of the normalized modulus and tensile strength as functions of relative density can be described by a type of power function. The acoustic emission (AE) technique, which is recognized as an effective tool for non-destructive testing and material evaluation, has been used to determine the damage threshold and obtain information about fracture mechanisms in the studied composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was made on the fracture surfaces to visualize the damage process: fibre fracture, matrix rupture and interface rupture.",0
"The pyrochlores in the series A 2Sb2O7 have been synthesized and characterized as exhibiting spin glass transitions at T SG=41, 4.5, and 2.6K (for A=Mn2+ S = 5 2 , Co2+ S = 3 2 and Ni2+ S=1, respectively) despite the lack of chemical disorder. Since the CurieâWeiss temperature remains essentially constant for all members in the series ( Î¸ â¼ â 40 K ), the frustration index for these materials increases significantly as the moment size is reduced from f = | Î¸ | / T SG = 1.1 (Mn2+), to 9.3 (Co2+) to 14.6 (Ni2+). There is also a corresponding change in the spin dynamics measured by the shift in the AC susceptibility signal as a function of frequency. These new materials provide an avenue to investigate the effect of quantum fluctuations on the Heisenberg pyrochlore lattice in the low spin limit, and show there is a dramatic change in the spin dynamics as the quantum regime is approached.",0
"Flash differential scanning calorimetry has been used to determine the glass transition response of the rapidly crystallizing energetic material, TNT. After heating at 600K/s, it was found that for cooling rates from 1000K/s to 10K/s the glass transition changes from 247.5K to 239.3K. The dynamic fragility index was determined to be m =62Â±6 and the activation energy determined from the range of cooling rates in which vitrification occurred was found to be 290Â±16kJ/mol. Crystallization was found to occur during cooling at rates below 0.3K/s, whereas cold crystallization was found on subsequent heating after cooling between 10K/s and 30K/s. At cooling rates of 100K/s and above, and for the same heating rate of 600K/s investigated, the glass transition event was observed, but cold crystallization during heating did not occur. Hence, the crystallization behavior of the fully amorphous TNT upon heating depends on the cooling rate and vitrification path.",0
"Concentration and temperature dependences of lifetime of Yb3+ : 2F5/2 level were investigated in tellurite glasses doped with up to 6 mol% Yb2O3. The lifetime obtained by 1.02 Î¼m emission from the Yb3+ ions at room temperature was insensitive to the Yb2O3 concentration in singly doped glasses. However, the Yb-lifetime showed strong concentration quenching with the presence of only 0.1 mol% Pr2O3. The energy transfer efficiency from Yb to Pr in a codoped glass was found to be more than 90% even in the glass of [Yb]/[Pr]>100. The Yb-lifetime in singly doped glass increased and that in codoped glass decreased with increasing temperature. These results can be explained by assuming rapid energy migration between Yb ions and promotion of Yb3+ : 2F5/2 âPr3+ : 1G4 transfer at higher temperature.",1
"Polymer concrete, is a composite material formed by polymerizing a monomer and an aggregate mixture. The polymerized monomer acts as the binder for the aggregates. Initiators and promoters are added to the resin prior to its mixing with the inorganic aggregates to initiate the curing reaction. Fracture behavior of chopped glass fiber reinforced polymer concrete was investigated in this study using the two-parameter model, according to RILEM recommendations. This is a direct method to calculate the flexural modulus of elasticity and two size-independent fracture parameters, i.e., the critical stress intensity factor, K IC, and the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD). Beams with a central notch were tested under three-point bending using an attached clip gauge to measure the CTOD. The chopped glass fibers used were 6 and 25 mm long. The fibers were also pre-treated to improve the adhesion between fibers and resin and fracture properties. In general, addition of fibers increases flexural strength and fracture properties of polymer concrete. The modulus of elasticity of glass fiber polymer concrete can increase by up to 39%. The object of this research work is to evaluate the influence of fibers on the mechanical and fracture properties of polymer concrete. This paper is a new contribution to a research field with a very small number of publications.",0
"The initiation and evolution behavior of the shear-bands and microcracks in a Ti-based metallic-glassâmatrix composite (MGMC) were investigated by using an in-situ tensile test under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the plastic deformation of the Ti-based MGMC related with the generation of the plastic deformation zone in crystalline and shear deformation zone in glass phase near the crack tip. The dendrites can suppress the propagation of the shear band effectively. Before the rapid propagation of cracks, the extending of plastic deformation zone and shear deformation zone ahead of crack tip is the main pattern in the composite.",0
"The dielectric relaxation spectroscopes of Cd x Se70âx Te30 (where x =0, 5, 7, 10) alloy have been investigated in the temperature range 298â373K and in the frequency range 100Hz to 100kHz near the percolation threshold. The frequency and temperature dependence on the dielectric constant showed a Debye dielectric relaxation process. Using Debye relation, the dielectric constant (Éâ²), the most probable relaxation time (Ï) and the barrier height (W) were estimated for binary ternary chalcogenide systems. In addition, the analysis of the results suggests that the effect of Cd content on electronic conduction of the system. The experimental results support to some extent the above criterion in the case of CdâSeâTe ternary alloy.",1
"Zinc magnesium oxide [Zn1â x Mg x O (0â©½xâ©½0.2)] nanofibers were grown by solution growth technique on glass substrate having zinc oxide (ZnO) seeds deposited onto them. The films were dense and characterized by strong reflections from (002) planes followed by reflections from (220) planes. Band gap varied between 3.14 and 3.75eV with magnesium content varying between 0.05 and 0.20. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra recorded at 10K for ZnO nanorods were dominated by a strong luminescence peak in the UV region at â¼3.13eV. With the addition of Mg in the ZnO lattice, a low-intensity PL peak started appearing in the blue region (â¼2.62â2.65eV). The films were also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman measurements.",0
"The properties of thermoplastics are temperature dependent owing to the fact that they are soft when heated and hard when cooled. An increase in temperature reduces the Young's modulus and tensile strength but increases the failure strain, leading to a material more ductile and less stiff. Of particular concern are under-the-hood thermoplastic parts that are required to be functional at elevated temperatures (around 80Â°C) encountered in and around the engine. The thermoplastic oil pan, for example, is subjected to the heat created by the engine, which is transferred via its connection by contact, the circulating oil and the surrounding air. The simulated influence of temperature on the polyamides PA66-GF35 and PA6-i-GF35 in a ribbed structure illustrates their impact resistance and their temperature dependency. The increase in temperature softened each material, which absorbed more impact energy in deformation. The rubber-modified material PA6-i-GF35 absorbed more energy in deflection and deformation compared to PA66-GF35. The brittleness of PA66-GF35 atÂ â20Â°C contributed to broken walls and ribs, whereas the toughness of PA6-i-GF35 allowed progressive damage on the structure, with ribs that absorbed the impact energy by crushing. PA6-i-GF35 also allowed larger distribution of the impact loading, which resulted in a reduced peak load compared to PA66-GF35 in the range of temperature studied (â20 to 120Â°C).",0
"Alumina ceramics and copper were vacuum brazed using a bismuth-borate-zinc glass at temperatures between 660 and 720â¯Â°C for 20â¯min. The interfacial phases were characterized and the influence of brazing temperatures on microstructure of the joints were investigated. Shear tests of brazed joints under different conditions were also performed, and the joint fracture was observed and analyzed to determine the influence of brazing temperatures on the joint mechanical properties. Al2O3 ceramic/Al2O3Â +Â glass phase/ZnAl2O4Â +Â glass phase/(Ni, Cu)O/Ni(s.s)Â +Â BiNi/copper was identified as the main structure of the Al2O3 joints brazed with the glass. As the brazing temperature increased, the (Ni, Cu)O oxide layer in the joint was observed to thicken and extend to both sides gradually. The amount of BiNi formed in the Ni coating layer increased, and the scattered ZnAl2O4 particles gradually grew. When the brazing temperature reached 700â¯Â°C, ZnAl2O4 particles agglomerated on the alumina ceramic side, and glass permeated into the alumina base material. The shear strength of the joint first increased and then decreased with the increase of brazing temperature. The shear strength reached the maximum value of 21.1â¯MPa when brazed at 680â¯Â°C.",0
The concentration dependence of the spin glass freezing temperature is calculated within the quantum version of the Edwards-Anderson theory. The distribution of nearest neighbor distances and self-damping of the RKKY interaction between spins are found to be important.,0
"The room-temperature time-dependent deformation of a CuâZr binary bulk metallic glass was investigated by performing nanoindentation creep experiments. Experimental results show that creep is much more pronounced in the as-cast sample than in the annealed sample. In both cases, the amount of creep displacement was found to increase with the loading rate. From the results, the influence of structural state and indentation rate on the creep behavior is discussed. Additionally, the stress exponent for the steady-state creep is estimated from the curve of creep displacement vs. holding time.",0
"Neodymium doped cadmium alkali borate glasses having composition 20CdO20R2O59.5H3BO3 0.5Nd2O3; (RÂ =Â Li, Na and K) were prepared by conventional melt-quenching technique. The amorphous nature of the glasses was confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. The physical properties such as density, refractive index, molar volume, rare earth ion concentration etc. were determined. Optical absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded. The Judd-Ofelt theory was applied on the optical absorption spectra of the glasses to evaluate the three phenomenological intensity parameters Î©2, Î©4 and Î©6. These parameters were in turn used to predict the radiative properties such as the radiative transition probability (A), radiative lifetime (Ï R ) and branching ratio (Î² R ) for the fluorescent levels of Nd3+ ion in the present glass series. The lasing efficiency of the prepared glasses has been characterized by the spectroscopic quality factor (Î©4/Î©6), the value of which is in the range of 0.2â1.5, typical for Nd3+ in different laser hosts. The variation of Î©2 with the change in alkali oxide has been attributed to the changes in the asymmetry of the ligand field at the rare earth ion site. The shift of the hypersensitive bands, study of the oscillator strengths and the variation of the spectral profile of the transition 4I9/2Â âÂ 4F7/2Â +Â 4S3/2 indicate a maximum covalency of NdO bond for glass with potassium ions. From the fluorescence spectra, peak wavelength (Î»p), effective line widths (ÎÎ»eff) and stimulated emission cross-section (Ïp) have been obtained for the three transitions 4F3/2Â âÂ 4I9/2, 4F3/2Â âÂ 4I11/2 and 4F3/2Â âÂ 4I13/2 of Nd3+ ion. The relatively high values of Ïp obtained for Nd3+ in present glass system suggest that these materials can be considered as suitable candidates for laser applications. The glass with potassium ions shows the highest value of the stimulated emission cross-section.",1
"The microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of as-extruded Mg-11.5Gd-4.5Y-0.3Zr (wt%) alloy with Zn and Nd additions were investigated. The addition of Zn inhibits the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) due to the presence of the long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) phase. The addition of Nd promotes the precipitation of the Mg5RE (RE: rare earth) phase. The existence of the densely distributed Mg5RE phase before hot extrusion promotes the DRX in subsequent hot extrusion process and leads to grain refinement. The increase in the number of Mg5RE phase particles degrades the mechanical properties of the resultant alloy. After hot extrusion, the studied alloys exhibit a bimodal microstructure consisting of fine dynamic recrystallized (DRXed) grains of several microns and strongly textured course un-DRXed grains. The as-extruded Mg-11.5Gd-4.5Y-1.5Zn-0.3Zr alloy exhibits an excellent balance of strength and ductility (tensile yield strength of 371 Â± 3.0MPa and elongation of 7.2 Â± 0.8%). The alloy strengthening is attributed to the bimodal microstructure, the Mg5RE and LPSO phases, and the basal texture. The tensile yield strength of the as-extruded Mg-11.5Gd-4.5Y-1.5Zn-0.3Zr alloy can be further increased to 425 Â± 2.5MPa by precipitation hardening with the T5 treatment.",0
"Partitioning of low molecular weight species, such as oligomers, during melt blending is shown to contribute to relative shifts in recorded glass transition temperatures for immiscible blends of bisphenol-A polycarbonate and styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers. These observations indicate the problems in drawing conclusions about miscibility between two polymers solely from shifts of âone-numberâ Tg values.",0
Inelastic neutron scattering can be used to measure the energy spectrum of the normal modes of vibration of a glass. We present measurements of the spectrum for the metal-metalloid glass Pd80Si20 at 300 K. They show a principal peak around 23 meV energy followed by a rapid fall. In these respects they closely resemble the known spectrum from crystalline pure palladium. We conclude that the inter-metallic forces in the metal-metalloid glass are not greatly modified from those in the crystalline form of the metal constituent.,0
"Structural inhomogeneity or metastable phase separation has been found in glass samples in the Geî¸S and Geî¸Se systems. The phase separation phenomena were observed after various heat treatments, and the morphology together with the chemical composition of its micro-phase constituents was studied. A pronounced separation of S or Se-rich phase appears when the S or Se content is sufficiently high (> 80 at.%). This probably results from the existence of two different types of structural groups (S or Se rings or chains and GeS4 or GeSe4 tetrahedra) which create an immiscibility tendency in undercooled glass melts.",1
"Glasses with the compositions of 22.5RE2O3â47.5WO3â30B2O3 (mol%) (RE: Gd, Eu) were prepared by a conventional melt quenching method, and Î±-Gd2(WO4)3 and Î±-Eu2(WO4)3 crystals were synthesized through their crystallization. The two types of WO4 tetrahedra present in Î±-RE2(WO4)3 provide the Raman bands at 931â934cmâ1 for WIIO4 tetrahrdra with much distortions and at 946â950cmâ1 for WIO4 tetrahedra with a near regular symmetry. The crystallized samples containing Î±-Eu2(WO4)3 exhibit strong red emissions under the excitation at 396 and 467nm, although the base glass has no photoluminescence emission. Î±-Gd2(WO4)3 and Î±-Eu2(WO4)3 crystals were patterned on the glass surface by irradiations of a continuous wave Yb:YVO4 fiber laser (wavelength: 1080nm).",1
"We predict the phase transition into the density wave ground state, analogous to Peierls transition, induced by magnetic breakdown in the quasi one-dimensional metallic system of interacting electrons in high magnetic fields. The formation of density wave transforms the open Fermi surface into the chain of large pockets with electron orbits enveloping them. The quantum tunneling through the gaps between the neighboring orbits lowers the total energy of the system due to delocalization of electron motion in that direction thus granting the stability of the density wave.",0
"Since increasing Ti content in Ti-based metallic glasses would benefit their specific strength, developing Ti-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with high Ti content has drawn great attention of researchers. However, excessive Ti content usually deteriorates their glass forming ability (GFA), especially for Ti-based BMGs with Ti content higher than 50 at.%. Here, based on the Ti55Zr15Be20Ni10 BMG with a critical diameter of 5 mm, the (Ti55Zr15Be20Ni10)100-xFex alloys were designed and investigated. The (Ti55Zr15Be20Ni10)96Fe4 BMG exhibited a critical diameter of 10 mm, suggesting GFA of the Ti55Zr15Be20Ni10 BMG could be improved by Fe addition. In addition, their yield strength increased with Fe addition, thus the specific strength was enhanced from 3.98â¯Ãâ¯105â¯Nâ¯m/kg to 4.46â¯Ãâ¯105â¯Nâ¯m/kg, providing the most optimal scheme of specific strength and GFA among the reported Ti-based BMGs. The developed BMGs exhibited high pitting potentials in 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, which were 1.8~2.8 times higher than that of 304 stainless steel. The present result shows that the developed Ti-based BMGs containing high Ti content, combined with high specific strength, large glass forming ability and good corrosion resistance, are promising for applications requring lightweight alloys.",0
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been used to characterize surface structures of Sn thin films grown on SiO2 glass substrates. The surface morphology of the Sn thin films is found to be strongly dependent on the film thickness and the growth temperature. The 100-nm-thick Sn film grown at 330 K is mainly composed of flat-top islands with a grain size of 400 nm in diameter and shows the preferred orientation of the a-axis perpendicular to the substrate surface.,0
"Effect of abrasive particle concentration on material removal rate (MRR), MRR per particle and the surface quality in the preliminary chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of rough glass substrate was investigated. Experimental results showed that the MRR increases linearly with the increase of abrasive concentration and reaches to the maximum when the abrasive concentration is 20wt.%, and then tends to be stable. When the abrasive concentration increases from 2 to 5wt.%, the MRR per particle increases greatly and reaches a peak. Then the MRR per particle decreases almost linearly with the increase of the abrasive concentration. The root mean squares (RMS) roughness almost decreases with increasing particle concentration. In addition, in situ coefficient of friction (COF) was also conducted during the polishing process and the zeta potentials of abrasive particles in slurry with different solid concentration were also characterized. Results show that COF value is not related to zeta potential but be sensitive to glass surface conditions in terms of rough peaks in preliminary polishing of glass substrate.",0
"Optical absorption and photoluminescent properties of Ho3+/Yb3+ co-doped tellurite and zinc halide tellurite glasses are investigated. The effect of zinc halides as modifier on the luminescence properties of above mentioned samples has been explored. Two intense upconversion emission bands centered at 546 (5F4, 5S2 â 5I8) and 660 (5F5 â 5I8) nm are observed when samples are excited by 976nm radiation. Zinc halides act as quencher when 976nm excitation source is used. The up and downconversion emission spectra are recorded with 532nm excitation source also. In this case also, zinc halides do not show any improvement. The dependence of upconversion intensities on excitation power and temperature is discussed. The power dependence study shows a quadratic dependence of fluorescence intensity on the excitation power while decrement in emission intensity of different transitions at different rates is observed in temperature dependence study. The possible upconversion mechanisms are also discussed in order to understand the energy transfer between Yb3+ and Ho3+ ions.",1
"In this study, we effectively improved the electrical conductivity of poly(ethylene-3,4-dioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulphonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) thin film by introducing various concentrations of our highly conductive synthesized graphene. The electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS was enhanced from 597418.17 to 899076.24 S/m when a 2â¯mg/ml concentration of graphene was added to the PEDOT:PSS. However, the addition of graphene in excess (2.5â¯mg/ml) decreased the conductivity to 719130.49 S/m, which might have been because of further defects being generated in the film that obstructed the fast transport of charge carriers to the current probes of the four-point probe. X-ray diffraction pattern, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses suggest that the graphene-PEDOT:PSS composite contained various kinds of chemical functionalizations that provided an additional pathway in the form of cross-linking bridges for the very quick transport of free charge carriers from the voltage probe to the current probe, resulting in enhanced carrier mobility.",0
"Mixing of the collinear antiferromagnet Pt3Fe and collinear ferromagnets Pt3Mn or Pd3Fe, respectively, leads to single phase solid solutions Pt3(Mn1-x Fe x ) and (Pd1-x Pt x )3Fe, all with Cu3Au type superstructure. We establish magnetic phase diagrams and show that in both systems a reentrant spin glass phase exists in intermediate concentration ranges.",0
"Emission properties of Ho3+ at 2.0Î¼m and the energy transfer mechanism between Yb3+, Er3+ and Ho3+ ions in fluorophosphate glasses are investigated. The measured emission spectra show that the 5 I 7 â 5 I 8 transition of Ho3+ upon 980nm laser diode excitation is strong. JuddâOfelt intensity parameters (Î©Î» , Î» =2, 4, 6), spontaneous transition probability (A rad), radiative lifetime (Ï r), absorption cross section (Ï a), stimulated emission cross section (Ï e) and FWHMÃ Ï e peak for the transition of Ho3+: 5 I 7 â 5 I 8 are calculated and discussed. The obtained results show that the present Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+ triply-doped fluorophosphate glass can be identified to be a promising material at 2.0Î¼m emission.",1
"The (Zr0.55Al0.1Ni0.05Cu0.3)100âx Ti x alloys were prepared using an in-situ suck-casting method in a copper mold. The effects of Ti addition on the microstructure, mechanical and corrosion properties of the (Zr0.55Al0.1Ni0.05Cu0.3)100âx Ti x alloys were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, compressive tests and corrosion tests. It has been found that the addition of Ti higher than 4% (mole fraction) causes the formation of many crystalline phases in the alloy. The alloys with 1%â3%Ti display an obvious yield stage on their compressive stressâstrain curves. An appropriate addition of Ti can improve the strength and ductility of the alloys. All the alloys have high corrosion resistance in 1 mol/L NaOH solution, and are corroded in 1 mol/L HCl solution. However, the appropriate addition of Ti can significantly improve the corrosion resistance of the alloys in HCl solution.",0
"Near-infrared luminescence properties of Nd3+ and Ho3+ ions in barium gallo-germanate glasses have been reported. Several spectroscopic parameters for Nd3+ and Ho3+ ions have been determined from the Judd-Ofelt analysis and absorption/luminescence measurements. Quite large luminescence lifetime, quantum efficiency and stimulated emission cross-section have been obtained for the main 4F3/2â¯ââ¯4I11/2 (Nd3+) and 5I7â¯ââ¯5I8 (Ho3+) laser transitions of rare earths in barium gallo-germanate glasses. It suggests that barium gallo-germanate glass is promising for near-infrared laser application at emission wavelengths 1064â¯nm (Nd3+) and 2020â¯nm (Ho3+).",1
"Two types of ball milling methods, wet planetary ball milling and dry tumbling ball milling, were used to grind fused silica powders for the preparation of silica-based suspensions in this experiment. The effect of surface hydration and particle shape caused by the two milling methods on the slurry rheology was investigated. The results showed that, with similar particle size distribution, the viscosity of the suspensions prepared from the powders milled by wet ball milling ranged from 275mPas to 311mPas within 20min and the suspension exhibited a continuous shear thickening behaviour whereas the viscosity of the suspensions prepared from the powders milled by dry ball milling ranged from 69mPas to 74mPas and the suspension exhibited a shear thinning behaviour first, and then exhibited a slightly shear thickening behaviour. The reasons were attributed to the differences in surface hydration and particle shape. It was postulated that the two factors affected the slurry rheology through the modification of particle interactions during the flow of high concentration suspensions.",0
"The main aim of paper is to conduct finite element analysis of sandwich composites under different loadings. Sandwich composites of Glass fabric reinforced Epoxy skins and Rigid Poly Urethane FoamCore of three different densities are tested under three-point bending setup to obtain the flexural properties, Foam cores are tested under tension and compression to evaluate their axial behavior. Sandwich specimens are tested in T-Peel, Single Lap Shear and Double Lap shear to evaluate their shear behavior under tensile loading and to observe mode-I, mixed mode, and mode-II failure of specimens.Forall ofthe above tests Finite Element Analysis(FEA) is carried out using ANSYSâ¢ and experimental and FEM values are verified. In three-point Bending test Sandwich beams are fabricated and tested with different skin to core weight ratios and different span to depth ratios and while testing different failure modes are observed. These Failure modes are correlated with FEM and failure criteria are applied as per failure and all the obtained values are compared.",0
"Results of temperature and frequency dependence of nuclear spin relaxation (NSR) are presented for different inorganic glasses between 0.4 K and the glass transition temperature. Below about 200 K, the data can be interpreted consistently in the framework of thermally activated low-frequency excitations of disordered modes. The modes are described by asymmetric double well potential (ADWP) configurations with suitable densities of states. Above about 200 K, the NSR is due to diffusive jumps of ions but deduction of corresponding transport properties (i.e. diffusion coefficients) from such data by means of standard NSR theories turns out to be difficult. Models are discussed which attempt to overcome these difficulties by relating the NSR with electrical conductivity. Further, deuterium NMR is shown to elucidate the motional mechanism of D2O molecules and dynamical properties of the glass transition in electrolyte glasses.",1
"Ho3+ and Er3+ doped lithium tellurite glasses have been formed with different concentrations of rare earth and their optical properties are derived on the basis of their absorption and fluorescence spectra. Intense upconversion emission in ultraviolet/violet, green and red regions have been observed when these glasses are pumped with NIR radiation. A preliminary study indicates that they can be used as temperature sensors.",1
"Waste glass recycling helps mitigating the problem of shortage of landfilling space, and it is especially of great importance for cities like Hong Kong where a local glass manufacturing industry is not available. This paper presents an innovative way of using recycled glass cullet (GC) in Alkali-activated cement (AAC) based mortars. Both mono-sized and mix-sized recycled GC were used as aggregates. The results showed that significant strength improvement was achieved after 2Â h of exposure to 800Â Â°C, despite of the size of the aggregates that was used. Up to 200% strength increment can be achieved for GC-AAC mortars with selected aggregate size. Meanwhile, Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) based specimens were prepared for comparison and detrimental strength loss was observed. Microstructural analysis indicated that the improved mechanical properties after the high temperature test was attributed to the denser paste formed as a result of recycled glass aggregates annealing as well as the better bonding between the paste and the aggregates. Microhardness test showed that the heated AAC paste had significantly higher stiffness than the original paste before the elevated temperature exposure.",0
"Cu-based and Zr-based bulk metallic glasses matrix/tungsten fiber composites were produced by infiltration process at different temperatures and times. A characterization based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is presented. The composites were tested in compression and hardness. The quality of bulk metallic matrix composites is not only experienced by the properties of the matrix and reinforcement but also by the controlling of the infiltration conditions, such as infiltration temperature and time. These parameters are important for wet-ability and interface reaction of the liquid with the reinforcement. It has been found that the reaction layer cannot be detected between the wires and matrix for Cu-base BMGCs; this may be an important difference between Zr-base and Cu-base BMG matrices and their deformation mechanism.",1
"Processes involving visible to infrared energy conversion are presented for Pr3+âYb3+ co-doped fluoroindate glasses. The emission in the visible and infrared regions, the luminescence decay time of the Pr3+:3P0 â 3H4 (482nm), Pr3+:1D2 â 3H6 (800nm), Yb3+:2F5/2 â 2F7/2 (1044nm) transitions and the photoluminescence excitation spectra were measured in Pr3+ samples and in Pr3+âYb3+ samples as a function of the Yb3+ concentration. In addition, energy transfer efficiencies were estimated from Pr3+:3P0 and Pr3+:1D2 levels to Yb3+:2F7/2 level. Down-Conversion (DC) emission is observed due to a combination of two different processes: 1-a one-step cross relaxation (Pr3+:3P0 â 1G4; Yb3+:2F7/2 â 2F5/2) resulting in one photon emitted by Pr3+ (1G4 â 3H5) and one photon emitted by Yb3+ (2F7/2 â 2F5/2); 2-a resonant two-step first order energy transfer, where the first part of energy is transferred to Yb3+ neighbor through cross relaxation (Pr3+:3P0 â 1G4; Yb3+:2F7/2 â 2F5/2) followed by a second energy transfer step (Pr3+:1G4 â 3H4; Yb3+:2F7/2 â 2F5/2). A third process leading to one IR photon emission to each visible photon absorbed involves cross relaxation energy transfer (Pr3+:1D2 â 3F4; Yb3+:2F7/2 â 2F5/2).",1
"The effects of the environment on glass fabric reinforced polyester and vinylester composites immersed in distilled water. Tests were performed at a temperature of 70Â°C with the materials exposed to 100% relative humidity and 25% ultimate tensile strength. Changes in weight, ultimate strength and tensile modulus of different composites were measured over an eight-month period, and the effects of the environment on these parameters were assessed.",0
"The devitrification behaviour of specimens with compositions (2âx)Na2O(1+x)CaOÂ·3 SiO2, Oâ¤xâ¤ 1, was studied. The crystalline phases were identified by X-ray diffraction and the glass transition temperatures were determined by differential thermal analysis. The activation energies for the crystal growth were calculated from the inflection point temperatures detected on the derivation differential thermal analysis curves.",1
"The effect of a thermoplastic polyester elastomer (TPEE) on the damping properties and energy dissipation of PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) reinforced with short glass fibres is investigated in this study. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) showed that tan Î´ increased significantly as a result of the incorporation of TPEE, especially for frequencies below 60â¯Hz. With increasing frequency, the storage modulus increased and the loss moduli decreased, with the loss modulus being higher for the TPEE composite. Tensile cyclic loading tests showed that more energy was dissipated during the first loading/unloading cycle for PBT TPEE composites than for PBT ones. Damage, characterized by degradation of the elastic modulus during sequential loading-unloading cycles, was analysed at strain-rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2â¯sâ1. These experiments confirmed the DMA results and demonstrated that the TPEE composite dissipated more energy than the comparable PBT samples. SEM analysis showed that the incorporation of TPEE weakened the fibre-matrix interfacial bonding, especially in the ductile zones of the fracture surface. Moreover, localized deformation in the interface zone between glass fibres and the matrix was affected by the visco-damage behaviour, explaining the increase in the tan Î´ value for the TPEE composite.",0
"Three individual primary colors were generated from only one piece of Er3+âEu3+ co-doped oxygen-deficient germanate glass under UV light irradiation. Blue, green, and red emissions were originated from Ge-related oxygen-deficient defect centers (GODCs), Er3+ ions, and Eu3+ ions, respectively. Detailed photoluminescence spectra, decay curve analyses, and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements were carried and the results indicate the existence of energy transfer between Er3+ and Eu3+ ions, GODCs and Eu3+ ions.",1
"The DC and AC conductivities of samples from the system (As2S3)100â x (AsSe0.5Te0.5I) x , where x=0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 50, 70 and 90mol%, were measured as a function of temperature. Besides, the AC conductivities of the samples with x=10 and 30 were measured as a function of frequency from room temperature to the glass transition temperature. The DC conductivity dependence on temperature is of the Arrhenius type, whereas the value of the pre-exponential factor suggests the electrical conduction by localized states in the band tails and by localized states near the Fermi level. The small values of the conduction activation energy (10â2â10â1 eV) obtained at higher frequencies suggest that the conduction in these materials is due to hopping of charge carriers between close defect states near the Fermi level.",1
"The enhanced magnetocaloric properties are studied in melt-extracted Gd36Tb20Co20Al24 metallic glass microwires. The Curie temperature is â¼91Â K for these microwires which show promising applications at liquid nitrogen range. The microwires possess spin glass phase in low temperature and spin freezing temperature is 60Â K. Notably, the maximum magnetic entropy change (âÎS M max), the relative cooling power (RCP) and the refrigerant capacity (RC) reach high values of 12.36Â JÂ kgâ1Kâ1, 948Â JÂ kgâ1 and 731Â JÂ kgâ1, respectively, under a field change of 5Â T. The large âÎS M max originates from the high effective magnetic moment. Meanwhile, the spin fluctuation, the exchange integral fluctuation of metallic glass and the second order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition enlarge the phase transition range.",0
"Spectroscopic characterization of fiber preforms fabricated with alkali bismuth gallate (KBG) and fluorophosphate glasses (FP) doped with Ho3+ and Yb3+ are reported. Luminescent properties of the preforms are studied in the near-IR spectral range using 2W, 975nm diode laser pumping. Results indicate that both glasses are potentially promising for lasing in the 1.2Î¼m and in the 2.2â2.5Î¼m spectral range.",1
"A molecular dynamics study of the effect of a single B2âCuZr precipitate on the mechanical properties of C u 50 Z r 50 metallic glass nanowires is presented. Four different samples are considered: three with a 2, 4 and 6Â nm radii precipitate and a precipitate-free sample. These systems are submitted to uniaxial tensile test up to 25% of strain. The interface region between the precipitate and the glass matrix has high local atomic shear strain, activating shear transformation zones, which concentrates in the neighborhood of the precipitate. The plastic regime is dominated by necking, and no localized shear band is observed for the samples with a 4 and 6Â nm radii precipitate. In addition, the yield stress decreases as the size of the precipitate increases. Regarding the precipitate structure, no martensitic phase transformation is observed, since neither the shear band hit the precipitate nor the stress provided by the tensile test is enough to initiate the transformation. It is concluded that, in contrast to the case when multiple precipitates are present in the sample, a single precipitate concentrates the shear strain around its surface, eventually causing the failure of the nanowire.",0
"The oxidation behavior of K38G superalloy, which is mechanically polished or sand blasted and then coated with glass matrix composite coatings, is investigated at 1000Â°C. Results indicate that sand blasting pre-treatment enhances the resistance to oxidation and spallation of the glass coatings on superalloys by promoting formation of an alumina interlayer. The most important factors favoring formation of this alumina interlayer are discussed in terms of that sand blasting not only changes the microstructure of alloy, it also modifies the alloy composition at surface by affecting the progressing of interfacial reactions between the superalloy substrates and glass coatings.",0
"We present the magnetization results obtained for a single crystal of U3As4 along the easy <111> and hard <001> axes, in static external fields up to 20.5 T at various temperatures. The magnetization jumps have been observed in the hard direction for temperatures below about 105 K and external magnetic fields H c>140 T. From these measurements the temperature dependence of the anisotropy constants K 1 and K 2 have been calculated. By using the Landau theory and renormalization group approach the tricritical point, from which the magnetization jump vanishes, has been determined.",0
"Polyamide 6,6 (PA6,6) hybrid composites toughened with maleated styreneâethylene butyleneâstyrene (SEBS-g-MA) and reinforced with 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30% short glass fiber (SGF) were prepared via melt blending followed by injection molding. The matrix blend of composites consisted of 80 wt.% PA6,6 and 20 wt.% SEBS-g-MA. The impact fracture resistance of injection-molded PA6,6/SEBS-g-MA 80/20 blend and its hybrid composites was investigated. Drop weight Charpy impact test showed that the hybrids exhibit much higher notched impact strength than the PA6,6 polymer under various test velocities of 1â5 m sâ1. Tough PA6,6/SEBS-g-MA 80/20 blend was not broken under the test velocities employed. The Charpy test is not a good technique to characterize the impact fracture behavior of tough polymer blend. The impact fracture resistance of tough PA6,6/SEBS-g-MA 80/20 blend can be characterized successfully using the essential work of fracture (EWF) concept under a speed of 3 m sâ1. Moreover, impact EWF measurements indicate the specific essential fracture work of hybrids to decrease with increasing SGF content. The specific non-essential plastic work was absent in hybrids owing to glass fibers restricting shear yielding of the matrix of composites.",0
"The liquid-glass transition for Zrî¸Ni alloy is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation and the empirical many-body potential described by the embedded atom method. The structure, distributions of the atomistic local site energy and the mean square force are investigated. The amorphous structure is compared with the crystal structure at room temperature. The potential, kinetic and total site energy distributions exhibit Maxwell-Boltzmann-type profiles. The liquid-glass transition is clearly detected for the atomistic site energy, and equivalently for each specimen. The results are discussed from the viewpoint of non-equilibrium. The mean square force exhibits an exponential dependence on the temperature.",0
"A series of polycrystalline ferrites having nominal chemical composition Co0.50âx Mn x Zn0.5Fe2O4 (0<x<0.4) have been synthesized by the solid-state reaction technique. The XRD analysis confirms single phase cubic spinel structure for all compositions. Lattice constant increases from 0.84195 to 0.84429nm with the increasing Mn content and obeys Vegard's law. The average grain size increases by increasing both Mn content and sintering temperatures. Room temperature saturation magnetization increases for x=0.1 and decreases for increasing Mn content. The coercivity decreases with increasing Mn content due to the decrease of anisotropy constant. A reentrant spin glass behavior of these samples is observed from the zero field cooled magnetization measurements. The real part of the initial permeability increases by increasing both Mn content and sintering temperatures. This is due to the homogeneous grain growth and densification of the ferrites. The highest initial permeability 137 is observed for x=0.4 sintered at 1573K on the other hand, the highest relative quality factor (2522) is obtained for the sample Co0.2Mn0.3Zn0.5Fe2O4 sintered at 1523K. The Mn substituted Co0.50âx Mn x Zn0.5Fe2O4 ferrites showed improved magnetic properties.",0
"Compared to crystalline metals, metallic glasses (MGs) show an exceptional feature of improved ductility after being mechanically processed by wire drawing. However, its underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, with the aid of atomistic simulations, wire drawing and subsequent tensile loading were performed on MG nanowires to systematically investigate the deformation mechanisms of MGs in wire drawing, the deformation-induced heterogeneities and their influences on the tensile ductility. The results revealed that the deformation mechanisms of MGs in wire drawing are closely associated with the area reduction ratio (R): at a small R of 4.7%, the area reduction is realized via shear transformations of atoms near the surface, leaving the core intact; while at a large R of 9.3%, it relies on the formation of multiple spatially distributed shear bands that redistributes the plasticity throughout the sample. The deformation-induced heterogeneities were understood through the detailed analysis of the resultant residual strain and stresses, the gradient rejuvenated amorphous structures, the unique free volume distribution and spatially distributed shear bands. Moreover, the tensile simulations revealed improved ductility synchronized with decreased yield strength of the drawn samples. The improved ductility is attributed to the synergistic effects of three beneficial factors: 1) The surface compressive residual axial stress leads to a shift of the yield sites from the surface to the core, suppressing the rapid formation of shear bands; 2) The rejuvenated structures near the surface constrain and accommodate the plastic deformation in the core; 3) The spatially distributed shear bands, generated at large R, serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites for highly dispersed plastic shearing. The findings provide a comprehensive elucidation of the deformation-induced heterogeneities of MGs in wire drawing and establish a physical relationship between these heterogeneities and mechanical properties, which can serve to interpret the experimental results.",0
"Glass transition temperatures of several polymers were determined in polymer-salt mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Experiments show variation in glass transition temperature (T g) with salt content and constancy of change in heat capacity (ÎC P) with it. We discuss change in T g in thermodynamic terms. Polymer-salt mixtures were prepared by solution casting method. Lithium perchlorate served as inorganic salt. Increase as well as decrease in T g with salt content can be observed in range of low salt content. Beyond saturation of salt in the mixture, result of T g shows phase decay into salt-rich and salt-poor phases.",0
"Te4+/Yb3+ co-doped 80%TeO2 20%Li2O glasses (amounts in mol%) were prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method in an ambient atmosphere, in order to investigate their optical characteristics for application in solar cells. An efficient near-infrared down-conversion mechanism was observed in these samples, involving the emission of two near infrared photons (at around 978â¯nm) after the absorption of one photon in the ultraviolet-blue region. This effect occurred by means of a process of cooperative energy transfer (CET) from Te4+ to Yb3+ ions. The CET efficiency (Î· CET ) was calculated from radiative transitions (lifetime) and also by a new method, developed in this work, based on rate equations quantifying the non-radiative transitions (thermal effect) involved in the system. The two methods showed very good agreement, with Î· CET between 82 and 100% obtained for the sample prepared using a higher Yb3+ concentration (4â¯mol%). The results suggested that these tellurite materials could have potential applications in improving the efficiency of silicon-based solar cells.",1
"Trivalent rare-earth (RE=Eu, Sm) doped transparent nano-glassâceramics comprising BaYF5 nanocrystals were successfully obtained by appropriate heat-treatment of the corresponding precursor solâgel glasses. Their structural and spectroscopic properties were investigated and compared with those for Eu3+-doped-BaYF5 nanocrystals prepared by a solvothermal method. X-ray Diffraction, Transmission Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy measurements confirmed the distribution of BaYF5 nanocrystals in the glass matrix, presenting a cubic phase structure with space group Fm-3m. In order to achieve a further structural characterization, the luminescence properties of the Eu3+ and Sm3+ dopants were also used as sensitive probes. The reduction in the emission intensities of hypersensitive transitions 5D0 â 7F2 and 4G5/2 â 6H9/2 for Eu3+ and Sm3+ ions respectively, along with time-resolved measurements, confirm the distribution of a significant fraction of RE ions into the fluoride nanocrystal environment. These results suggest that BaYF5 nano-glassâceramics doped with Eu3+ or Sm3+ can be considered as potential red-emitting phosphors for the development of white LEDs under near UV excitation.",1
"In this investigation a new third generation advanced high strength steel (AHSS) has been developed. This steel was synthesized by austempering of a low carbon and low alloy steel with high silicon content. The influence of austempering temperature on the microstructure and the mechanical properties including the fracture toughness of this steel was also examined. Compact tension and cylindrical tensile specimens were prepared from a low carbon low alloy steel and were initially austenitized at 927Â°C for 2h and then austempered in the temperature range between 371Â°C and 399Â°C to produce different microstructures. The microstructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and optical metallography. Test results show that the austempering heat treatment has resulted in a microstructure consisting of very fine scale bainitic ferrite and austenite. A combination of very high tensile strength of 1388MPa and fracture toughness of 105MPaâm was obtained after austempering at 371Â°C.",0
"The removal of hydroxyl from silica glass produced by melting quartz powder under an atmosphere containing hydrogen was investigated. After heat-treatment at the temperature range (700â1200Â°C) in nitrogen atmosphere, the effective hydrogen diffusion coefficients were evaluated based on the law of nonsteady-state diffusion. The activation energy obtained is 254kJmolâ1 for the dehydroxylation process in the heat-treatment temperature range of 700â900Â°C, and a different activation energy calculated is 32kJmolâ1 in the temperature range of 900â1200Â°C. The activation energies for the dehydroxylation process at the temperature (700â900Â°C) and the higher temperature (900â1200Â°C) correspond to the binding energy of SiOâH bond and the activation energy for the diffusion of hydrogen in silica glass respectively, which indicate there is a change of mechanism for dehydroxylation with heat-treatment temperature.",1
"Hydrostatic extrusion of a Zr38Ti17Cu10.5Co12Be22.5 bulk metallic glass/porous tungsten phase composite was performed, and the dynamic compressive deformation and fracture behavior of the as-extruded composite were investigated in detail at room temperature by means of the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). In comparison with the as-cast composite, the as-extruded composite presented a much higher flow stress without sacrificing plasticity under dynamic compression, exhibiting ductility increment, but evidence of work softening was observed. The specimen for the as-extruded composite failed by axial splitting with occasional shear fracture in some regions. It is suggested that the increase in flow stress and ductility of the as-extruded composite is attributed to the extrusion process which introduced hardened condition and texture in the tungsten phase as well as the 3D net structure of the porous tungsten phase. The work softening mechanism appears to be essentially associated with the large number of microcracks and voids under dynamic compression.",0
"In this paper, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of and energy transfer processes in ErâTm co-doped bismuth silicate glass. The JuddâOfelt parameters of Er3+ and Tm3+ are calculated, and the similar values indicate that the local environments of these two kinds of rare earth ions are almost the same. When the samples are pumped at 980nm, the emission intensity ratio of Tm:3F4 â 3H6 to Er:4I13/2 â 4I15/2 increases with increased Er3+ and Tm3+ contents, indicating energy transfer from Er:4I13/2 to Tm:3F4. When the samples are pumped at 800nm, the emission intensity ratio of Er:4I13/2 â 4I15/2 to Tm:3H4 â 3F4 increases with increased Tm2O3 concentration, indicating energy transfer from Tm:3H4 to Er:4I13/2. The rate equations are given to explain the variations. The microscopic and macroscopic energy transfer parameters are calculated, and the values of energy transfer from Er:4I13/2 to Tm:3F4 are found to be higher than those of the other processes. For the Tm singly-doped glass pumped at 800nm and ErâTm co-doped glass pumped at 980nm, the pumping rate needed to realize population reversion is calculated. The result shows that when the Er2O3 doping level is high, pumping the co-doped glass by a 980nm laser is an effective way of obtaining a low-threshold â¼2Î¼m gain.",1
A phase transition of nuclear matter into a periodic phase has been found. Studying the properties of this phase transition an analogy has been observed with the Peierls' transition taking place in quasi-one-dimensional electric conductors.,0
The response of optical absorption to KrF excimer laser radiation is studied in germaniaâsilica and aluminaâgermaniaâsilica solâgel glasses. It is found that Al ion in aluminaâgermaniaâsilica specimen plays an important role in the defect conversion process under UV-irradiation. The irradiation results in photochemical conversion of Ge-related oxygen-deficient centers in samples with bleaching of optical absorption centered at around 5.1eV. Samples containing aluminum exhibit higher conversion efficiency of Ge-related oxygen deficient centers than those without aluminum. The influence of aluminum ion in photochemical conversion is discussed.,1
"Hot isostatic pressing of BeO was performed using a glass as the pressure-transmitting medium in the range 1000Â°C to 1400Â°C and at 2000 kg/cm2. Specimens with theoretical density were obtained at relatively low temperature and for shorter pressing time. Their electron fractographs showed intergranular characteristics. Microstructure of the specimens indicated that grains were uniformly distributed and that abnormal grain growth was not recognized, but took place only at higher temperatures under pressure.",0
"The influence of Hf additions on the glass-forming ability (GFA), phase formation and mechanical properties of Cu50HfxZr50-x (xâ¯=â¯2,5,10,20â¯at.%) alloys has been systematically investigated. We report on a distinct correlation between phase formation and GFA of Cu50Zr50-based alloys. Increasing additions of Hf reduce the thermal stability of the high-temperature B2 Cu(Hf,Zr) phase, while the thermal stability of the corresponding undercooled melt is enhanced. The GFA of these alloy series gradually raises up to 10â¯at.% Hf, whereas at 20â¯at.%Hf, the GFA is drastically lowered, since the B2 Cu(Hf,Zr) phase becomes unstable and the precipitation of the low-temperature equilibrium phases is favoured. This interrelation determines the microstructure and results in the formation of Cu-Hf-Zr-based bulk metallic glass composites. These composites not only show appreciable macroscopic plastic strain, but also high yield strength.",0
Specific heat and susceptibility of an Ising spin glass system are calculated numerically. The spins are distributed randomly on a FCC lattice with concentration c. Enlargement of the number of spins shows no large effect whereas the change of the RKKY interaction produces a 1/T behaviour in the specific heat. The linear part of the specific heat is explained by the density of energy states.,0
"The sound velocities in GeS2 glass have been measured by means of ultrasonic interferometry as a function of temperature or pressure up to 1.8 kbar. The bulk modulus K s = 117.6 kbar and shear modulus G = 60.60 kbar were obtained for GeS2 glass at 15Â°C and 1 atm. The temperature derivatives of both sound velocities and elastic moduli are negative : ( âÎ½1 âT ) p = â1.54 Ã 10â4 km sec Â°C, ( âÎ½1 âT ) p = â1.27Ã 10â4 km sec Â°C and ( âKs âT ) p = â1.27 Ã 10â2kbar Â°C , ( âG âT ) p = â1.23 Ã 10â2 kbar/Â°C, ( âY âT ) p = â2.93 Ã 10â2 their pressure derivatives are positive: ( âÎ½1 âP ) T = 4.43Ã 10â2km/kbar, ( âÎ½1 âP ) T = 0.633 Ã 10â2km kbar and (âKsâP0)T=6.81, ( âG âP)T = 1.03, (âYâTT= 3.57. The GrÃ¼neisen parameter, Î³th= 0.298, and the second GrÃ¼neisen parameter, Î´s = 3.27, have also been calculated from these data. The elastic behavior of GeS2 glass has proved to be normal despite the structural similarity among the tetrahedrally coordinated SiO2, GeO2 and GeS2 glasses.",1
"Cerium oxide thin films are deposited on glass by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature and characterized by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. The effects of ambient gas, rate of deposition and fluence on growth of films have been studied. The films grown in forming gas and with a high rate of deposition are polycrystalline and show preferential orientation along <011> direction with a roughness of â¼2Â nm. Films prepared in oxygen have low crystallinity.",0
We present a systematic study of the magnetic field induced metalâinsulator transition in quasi-three-dimensional wide quantum wells by numerical calculations. Depending on carrier density and carrier mobility we observe both a change from metal to insulator-like temperature dependence as well as a magnetic field dependent transition between both regimes.,0
"Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) promise to increase the mechanical properties of the fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites exceptionally without virtually accounting for the increase in weight. Some of these include tensile strength, damping performance, impact energy absorbing capability. This research work experimentally examines the tensile behavior of three phased glass/epoxy/MWCNTs composite. The MWCNTs were mixed with resins having 0 wt.% (reference specimen), 0.5 wt.%, 1wt.% and 1.5 wt.% in order to compare enhancement in maximum tensile strength. Symmetrical laminate with eight plies (4.0Â±0.1 mm thickness) is fabricated by using hand layup technique assisted by vacuum bagging method at 1 atm. Tensile specimen size was taken as per ASTM (D3039) standard and experiments are carried out on HOUNSFIELD H50KS universal testing machine (UTM). The results from experiment concluded an increase in strength continuously with the increase in MWCNTs up to 1 wt.% of reinforcements, while further increase in MWCNT doping decreases the tensile strength. This research work is directly applicable in the industries where higher tensile strength is required such as structural, aerospace, automobiles industries etc.",0
"A novel and thin ZnO compact blocking film is employed at the interface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and mesoporous TiO2, and its influence on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is investigated. The ZnO film prepared by spin-coating method on FTO is characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UVâvis spectrophotometer. The ZnO film is firstly employed as an energy barrier between FTO and mesoporous TiO2 film in DSSCs, which improves open-circuit photovoltage (V oc) and fill factor (FF) with compensation of J sc decrease, finally increasing energy conversion efficiency from 5.85% to 6.70%. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) technique reveal that the existence of the energy barrier not only resulted in the effect of suppressing back electrons transfer from FTO to electrolyte but also blocking the electrons injection from the conductive band of TiO2 to FTO. The former effect effectively reduces the recombination which occurs in the region of FTO substrate, and the latter leads to remarkable increment of electron density in the TiO2, thus resulting in enhanced V oc and FF. These results suggest that the methodology of introducing the semiconductor with a more negative conduction band edge than TiO2 as the compact blocking film in DSSCs may be feasible.",0
"The requirements for Mo-wire for hard glass sealing (matched seal) and Mo ESS-ribbon for quartz glass sealing (ductile-metal seal) will be discussed. Comparing the effect of various oxide additions to molybdenum, a correlation between the percentage of ionic bonding character of the oxide and the recrystallization temperature of the ODS-Mo could be found, owing to particle refining during deformation and heat treatment. For hard glass sealing the particle multiplication factor should be as high as possible (e.g. Mo-La2O3) in order to achieve ductility after the pinch-sealing operation. Quartz glass sealing demands an ESS-ribbon with a recrystallization temperature in the range of 1250 Â°C. A higher recrystallization temperature leads to higher stresses in the quartz glass (higher risk of quartz cracks), a lower recrystallization temperature results in a reduced yield owing to cracks in the ESS-ribbon. A good adherence between the ESS-ribbon and the quartz glass, which is a prerequisite for a long-term vacuum tight seal, is determined by mechanical bonding, chemical bonding, wettability and surface purity of the ESS-ribbon. The Y2O3-Ce2O3 particles in MY (Mo-0.47 wt% Y2O3-0.08 wt% Ce2O3) which are surrounded by etching grooves lead to a âzip-fastener effectâ (improved mechanical bonding), a reduced wetting angle (pure Mo: 97.2 Â± 6.5 Â°, MY: 79.7 Â± 8.5 Â°; T = 2000 dgÂ°C, Ar) and the formation of Y2Si2O7. Using MY instead of pure Mo ESS-ribbon, the life time of halogen lamps at base temperatures of 430â540 Â°C could be improved by a factor of 2â3.",0
The devitrification behaviour and the electrical conductivity of five glasses near the lithium metasilicate composition have been studied using differential thermal analysis. X-ray diffraction and impedance analysis. All the studied glasses devitrify in two steps. The influences of replacing SiO2 by Al2O3and of the LiO2 content on the activation energy of crystal growth and of electrical conductivity have been pointed out.,1
"Tellurite glasses of the composition xPr6O11â(7â¯ââ¯x)La2O3â3Na2Oâ25ZnOâ65TeO2 (where xâ¯=â¯0.005, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2â¯mol%) were obtained by the melt quenching technique. Absorption (300â¯K), excitation (300â¯K) and fluorescence spectra (at 77 and 300â¯K) as well as fluorescence decay curves of the Pr3+-doped title glasses are presented and discussed. Basing on the Judd-Ofelt analysis, the phenomenological Judd-Ofelt parameters (Î©2â¯=â¯2.13, Î©4â¯=â¯16.8 and Î©6â¯=â¯3.50â¯Ãâ¯10â20â¯cm2), radiative transition probabilities (AT), branching ratios (Î²), radiative lifetimes (ÏR) and emission cross-sections (Ïem) were calculated for the luminescence from 3P1, 3P0, 1D2 and 1G4 levels of the Pr3+ ion. The fluorescence from the 1G4 level of the Pr3+ ion has been observed after excitation at 445â¯nm in the 3P2 state. The experimental lifetimes of the emission levels indicate strong concentration quenching. An analysis of non-radiative decay of the 1D2 level indicate that energy migration via a diffusion limited relaxation and cross-relaxation processes are involved in the depopulation of this level. The spectroscopic results show that the investigated glasses are potentially candidates as at 1.3â¯Î¼m and 1.45â¯Î¼m laser host as well as reddish-orange to yellow tunable phosphor. Furthermore, a near-infrared downconversion process gives possibility of using of these materials as luminescent solar concentrators and near infrared lasers.",1
"Evidence for a vortex-glass phase is found from nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics measured on YBa2Cu3O7âÎ´ thin films in high magnetic fields and at low temperatures. Well below the superconducting transition temperature the I-V curves are well described by E/J = Ï± 0 exp[â(J 0/J) Î¼ ], with E the electric field and J the current density. The exponent Î¼ is 0.19 Â± 0.05 for low values of current density and Î¼ = 0.94 Â± 0.1 at high values. The results at low J are characteristic of a vortex glass and constitute the first direct evidence that the low-temperature state of a disordered superconductor is a vortex glass. The results are at variance with predictions from the theory of collective flux creep. Near the phase transition, both Ï± 0 and J 0 exhibit critical behaviour.",0
"The magnetic domain structure of the Co70.4Fe4.6Si10B15 glass-covered amorphous microwires Joule-heated of different annealing currents (temperatures) is studied. From the magnetization curves and ferromagnetic resonance features obtained from the impedance spectra measured at different magnetic fields, a domain structure is proposed for the as-produced and Joule-heated microwires.",0
The glass-forming composition region of the tetrapropylammonium chlorideâwater system has been determined. The glass transition temperature (Tg) shows an anomalous concentration dependence.

"A serial of novel fluoro-tellurite glasses with compositions of 60TeO2â20BaOâ(20-x)ZnOâxZnF2 (xÂ =Â 0, 2, 4, 5 and 6Â mol%) were prepared. The compositional dependences of glass structural evaluation, Raman gain coefficient, UVâVis transmission spectrum, IR transmission spectrum, linear refractive index and third-order nonlinearity were analyzed. The results showed that the addition of 6Â mol% ZnF2 can further improve the Raman gain coefficient to as well as 52Â ÃÂ 10â11Â cm/W and effectively decrease around 73% and 57% absorption coefficients respectively caused by free OH groups (@3.3Â Î¼m) and hydrogen-bonded OH groups (@4.5Â Î¼m) in glass. Addition of ZnF2 does not change the UVâVis absorption edge, optical band gap energy and infrared region cut-off edge almost, while the linear refraction index and ultrafast third-nonlinearity show unmonotonic changes. These novel fluoro-tellurite glasses may be suitable candidates for using in mid-infrared Raman fiber laser and/or amplifier.",1
"Notch sensitivity, free edge delamination and brittle failure are limiting factors for the wider use of conventional composite laminates. In our previous study, a hybrid layup concept with the different materials blocked together but with dispersed orientations was successfully used to design pseudo-ductile hybrid composites with no free-edge delamination. This study introduces a comprehensive set of designed and characterised orientation-dispersed pseudo-ductile thin-ply hybrid composites to address notch sensitivity, another important limiting factor in conventional composite laminates. Un-notched, open-hole and sharp notched tension tests were performed on three different thin-ply carbon/glass hybrid configurations. The investigated laminates showed a successful pseudo-ductile un-notched behaviour with improved notch-insensitivity and suppression of free-edge delamination that was an undesirable damage mode in previously investigated hybrids with plies of the same orientation blocked together. This notch insensitivity results from subcritical damage in the laminates due to the pseudo-ductile damage mechanisms, i.e. dispersed delamination and fragmentation. These damage mechanisms can eliminate stress concentrations near the notch and suppress the conventional damage mechanisms that govern the notched response of the laminates.",0
"Objectives To evaluate the effects of thermal cycling on the flexural properties of composites reinforced with two differently sized fibers. Methods Acid-washed, woven, fused silica-glass fibers, were heat-treated at 500Â°C, silanized and sized with one of two sizing resins (linear poly(butyl methacrylate)) (PBMA), cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Subsequently the fibers were incorporated into a polymer matrix. Two test groups with fibers and one control group without fibers were prepared. The flexural properties of the composite reinforced with linear PBMA-sized fibers were evaluated by 3-point bend testing before thermal cycling. The specimens from all three groups were thermally cycled in water (12,000 cycles, 5/55Â°C, dwell time 30s), and afterwards tested by 3-point bending. SEM micrographs were taken of the fibers and of the fractured fiber reinforced composites (FRC). Results The reduction of ultimate flexural strength after thermal cycling was less than 20% of that prior to thermal cycling for composites reinforced with linear PBMA-sized silica-glass fibers. The flexural strength of the composite reinforced with cross-linked PMMA-sized fibers was reduced to less than half of the initial value. Significance This study demonstrated that thermal cycling differently influences the flexural properties of composites reinforced with different sized silica-glass fibers. The interfacial linear PBMA-sizing polymer acts as a stress-bearing component for the high interfacial stresses during thermal cycling due to the flexible structure of the linear PBMA above T g. The cross-linked PMMA-sizing, however, acts as a rigid component and therefore causes adhesive fracture between the fibers and matrix after the fatigue process of thermal cycling and flexural fracture.",0
"Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect of Ho2PtSi3, a new ternary intermetallic compound with the orthorhombic Ba2LiSi3-type structure, are studied by dc magnetization, ac susceptibility, magnetic relaxation, specific heat, and magnetic memory effect measurements. The experimental results indicate that this system undergoes a magnetic phase transition from a paramagnetic state to a ferromagnetic cluster state at a temperature T C ~ 6.5K followed by a cluster glass transition at T f ~ 5.8K. The typical cluster glass features observed below T f for Ho2PtSi3 include (1) broad peak in specific heat curve, (2) frequency dependent cusp in ac susceptibility curve, (3) evident irreversible magnetism, (4) long-time magnetic relaxation behavior, and (5) zero-field-cooling magnetic memory effect. On the other hand, the large values of magnetic entropy change, relative cooling power and adiabatic temperature change are estimated near T C under a field change. These results suggest that Ho2PtSi3 can be classified as a huge ferromagnetic cluster glass system with large magnetocaloric effect.",0
"In this work, we reported the fabrications and characterization of Er3+-doped Ge20Ga5Sb10Se65 glasses and glass-ceramics and measured their transmission and fluorescence spectra. The results showed that, the fluorecence intensity of the glasses increased until Er3+ concentration was up to â¼1.1â¯wt% Er, and then decreased with further increasing Er3+ concentration that was due to concentration quenching effect. While it was found that the mid- and far-infrared transmission did not decrease significantly in the glasses annealed at 310â¯Â°C for a duration up to 50â¯h, seven-folded enhancement in the intensity of mid-infrared fluorescence at 2.78â¯Î¼m was observed. This demonstrated the potentials of the materials used for Er-doped amplifier and fiber laser.",1
"A small glass tube containing oil and glass pebbles is constructed to evaluate rapidly the volumetric heat transfer characteristics during charging. An electrical hot-plate in thermal contact with a steel spiral coil is used to charge the oil/pebble-bed storage under different average charging flow rates. The heat transfer characteristics are presented in terms of the average temperature of the oil, the average temperature of the pebbles, the average charging power and the volumetric heat transfer coefficient. The results reveal that an increase in the average charging flow rate results in a linear increase in the volumetric heat transfer coefficient. An expression for the correlation between the superficial mass flow velocity, the average pebble diameter and the volumetric heat transfer coefficient is also formulated.",0
"In order to unravel the effect of free volume on the bending plasticity of Zr55Al10Ni5Cu30 bulk metallic glass (BMG) with monolithic amorphous structure, a series of samples with different free volume content and structural disorder degree were prepared by varying the remelting times of the master alloy ingots and annealing the as-cast samples at 673Â K. It is shown that both free volume and structural disorder degree influence the plasticity of the monolithic BMGs. Annihilating the excessive free volume from the BMG has a larger influence on the plasticity of the BMG that is more disordered in structure.",0
"Experimental results for two aspects of the behaviour of bolted joints in pultruded composite materials are presented. The points considered are the effects of the area and the material used for clamping on the bearing strength, and the effect of the end distance on the shear strength of materials which contain a high proportion of axial fibres.",0
