"The quark pair creation (QPC) model is found to predict a unique e.m. strength of the Î´ 0 Ïµ A J (Jeven) tadpole which dominates Î· â 3Ï decay and yields a width of 190 eV, in excellent accord with experiment (204 Â± 22 eV).",0
"A novel electrochemical deposition method for growth of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on indium tin oxide (ITO) thin film coated glass was investigated. The resulting electrode surface was characterized by SEM, UVâVis spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. The GNPs directly attached on the electrode surface with a quasi-spherical shape and their sizes of diameters were in the range of 20â35nm with a quite symmetric distribution. With increasing electrodeposition cycles of cyclic voltammetry, the density of GNPs on ITO electrode surface was increased. The potential utility of the GNPs modified ITO electrode was investigated. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was successfully immobilized on GNPs modified ITO electrode and the direct electron transfer between enzyme and electrode surface realized. The enzyme electrode exhibited a rapid and high response to superoxide anion.",0
"Non-rare-earth Bi was firstly used as sensitizer on Ho3+: 2.0Â Î¼m emission for its mid-infrared applications in successfully prepared germanosilicate glass under 808Â nm excitation. Sensitization mechanism has been analyzed theoretically through matched energy transfer processes based on the measured absorption, fluorescence spectra and calculated luminous parameters. Meanwhile, typical broadband near-infrared (NIR) emission band of Bi ions has also been obtained in present germanosilicate glass, which shifts to a longer wavelength with Ho3+ co-doped owing to the different of Bi-related active centers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy demonstrated that the addition of Ho3+ lead to the part valence conversion among the mixed-valence state of Bi. All results reveal that Bi/Ho co-doped germanosilicate glass might provide a new choice for 2.0Â Î¼m laser applications.",1
"Absorption spectra and the sites selective fluorescence spectra of Yb3+ in phosphate glass were investigated at temperatures between 8 and 300 K. Results show that there was an abnormal absorption line in absorption spectra at low temperatures, and the blue shift of the absorption peaks was discovered with the increase in temperature.",1
"This study investigates the effects of cold pre-forging (CPF) on the extrusion load during hot extrusion and on the microstructure and mechanical properties of extruded AZ80 alloy. For this purpose, a billet is forged to 10% strain at room temperature and then subjected to indirect extrusion at 200Â°C. The CPF process causes the formation of a large amount of deformation twins and an increase in the dislocation density of the billet. The cold-forged AZ80 billet exhibits a higher extrusion load during extrusion than an unforged AZ80 billet, owing to the occurrence of twin-boundary hardening and enhanced strain-hardening effects in the former. The initial twins introduced by the CPF process promote dynamic recrystallization behavior during extrusion because they act as nucleation sites for recrystallization. As a result, the CPF process increases the area fraction of fine recrystallized grains and the microstructural homogeneity of the extruded alloy. The AZ80 alloy extruded after CPF shows a higher tensile strength and ductility than the AZ80 alloy extruded without CPF. The improvement in strength is attributed mainly to the decrease in the average grain size caused by an increased recrystallization fraction. The increased ductility is due to the reduced area fraction of coarse unrecrystallized grains, in which microcracks occur during tensile plastic deformation.",0
"Optically transparent zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films having thickness of 70, 150, 200 and 270Â nm are deposited on heated glass substrates using the radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering method to examine their structural and waveguide properties. The XRD analyses show that the ZnO films on SiO2/Glass substrate are poly-oriented and have a hexagonal wurtzite structure. All thin films exhibit optical transmittance of >80% in the visible range. The increase in film thickness to 270Â nm leads to growth of crystallinity and grain size to 35Â nm, increase in the transmittance and refractive indexes for both TM and TE modes, and decrease in the bandgap energy. The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) exhibit UV (â¼3.20â3.23Â eV) and green (â¼2.37Â eV) emission for all samples. However, the peaks intensity for UV emission gradually decreases which is attributed to decrease in the concentration of photo-carriers, their aggregations and larger amount of energy transfer to the down layer. Achieving the high optical transmittance of 95%, high refractive indexes and high level of crystallinity for 270Â nm ZnO films prepared by socio economic rf magnetron sputtered make it appropriate transparent conductors for waveguide applications. The excellent features of the results suggest that our systematic growth and analysis methods may establish a basis for the tunable growth of ZnO/SiO2/glass hetero-structure thin films suitable in nanophotonics particularly waveguide application.",0
"A Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 bulk metallic glass has been developed by Nb partial substitution for Zr in Ti33Cu47Zr11Ni6Sn2Si1 alloy. The glass forming ability Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 alloy has been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry. Partial Nb substitutes for Zr promote the glass forming ability. Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 BMG with diameter of 3mm can be fabricated by Cu-mold injection casting method. The glass forming ability of Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 alloy is enhanced by stabilizing the undercooled liquid against crystallization. The plastic strain up to 2.5% was obtained for Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 BMG compared to 0.15% for Ti33Cu47Zr11Ni6Sn2Si1 BMG, which demonstrates that small amount of Nb addition can have a dramatic effect on plasticity enhancement in TiâCu-based BMG. The intersection and branching of the shear bands are observed. The plastic strain of the Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 BMG can be improved by the generation of nanocrystalline particles, which lead to multiple shear bands.",0
"Amorphous semiconductors As2âxSe3+x and As2âxS3+x have been prepared by glow discharge decomposition of a gas mixture of AsH3 î¸ H2Se and AsH3 î¸ H2S respectively. The films contain about 3â8 at. percent hydrogen according to infrared transmission measurements. Both S-H and Se-H vibrational modes were observed. Results of the D.C. electrical conductivity, X-ray structural analyses and optical absorption are presented. The films composition was found to be close to As:Se = As:S = 2 3 .",1
"The corrosion behaviour of two bulk glass-matrix composite alloys formed by copper mould casting was analysed: (i) Zr66.4Nb6.4Cu10.5Ni8.7Al8.0 with precipitated bcc dendrite phase and (ii) Zr57Ti8Nb2.5Cu13.9Ni11.1Al7.5 with quasicrystalline phase, respectively. The electrochemical behaviour was tested on the cross-sectional areas of the composite rod samples in 0.5M sulphuric acid solution with up to 0.5M sodium chloride addition by potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The composition of anodically formed passive films was studied by means of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The morphology of local damages generated by a chloride-induced pitting process was examined with scanning electron microscopy. In result of those studies, a pitting mechanism is described. For both composites in chloride media, a pronounced selective dissolution of the glassy matrix phase occurs, whereas the crystalline phases are not attacked. Niobium and titanium components are beneficial in inhibiting the pitting initiation due to their participation in the passive film formation. The dissolution of the glassy matrix phase is explained by the principal higher chloride reactivity of metastable phases compared to that of stable crystalline phases and by the detected enrichment of copper in these phase regions. The chloride attack progressing along the matrix phase causes the formation of deep channels in the bulk composite material leading to an excavation and, finally, detachment of the bcc dendrites or quasicrystals, respectively. The re-passivation ability is very poor.",0
"The effect of replacement of fine and coarse aggregates with recycled glass on the fresh and hardened properties of Portland cement concrete at ambient and elevated temperatures is studied. Percentages of replacement of 0â100% of aggregates with fine waste glass (FWG), coarse waste glass (CWG), and fine and coarse waste glass (FCWG) were considered. Soda-lime glass used for bottles was washed and crushed to fine and coarse aggregate sizes for use in the concrete mixes. Samples were cured under 95% RH at room temperatures (20â22Â°C), heated in the oven to the desired temperatures, allowed to cool to ambient temperatures, and then tested for their residual compressive strength. The compressive strength of the concrete samples made with waste glass was measured at temperatures up to 700Â°C. Moreover, the effect of the percentages of replacement with recycled glass on the slump values and initial and final setting time of concrete has also been measured. The results of this study showed that the compressive strength of concrete made with RG decreases up to 20% of its original value with increasing temperatures up to 700Â°C. In general, concretes made with 10% aggregates replacement with FWG, CWG and FCWG had better properties in the fresh and hardened states at ambient and high temperatures than those with larger replacement. Concretes made with FWG aggregates had higher compressive strengths than those made with CWG and FCWG at ambient and elevated temperatures.",0
"The crossover from superconducting gap to pseudogap is considered. We show that the superconductivity is destroyed at the temperature T c, with the superconducting gap being smoothly transformed into the pseudogap. Relations, which are of general interest, between the maximum values of the gap Î 1, T c and Tâ are established. We presents arguments that Tâ as a function of the doping level x is approximately a straight line that crosses the abscissa at some point x FC. In the vicinity of this point Tâ coincides with T c, and at x=x FC the fermion condensation quantum phase transition takes place.",0
"For the double oxides and other related double AxByCz compounds in the system AC-BC, linear correlations have been observed between standard enthalpies of formation of the double compounds AxByCz from the component compounds AC and BC (ÎH 0 f,cc in kJ (g-atom)â1 and values of the sum of the molar fraction enthalpies of the component compounds AC and BC (Î H Ì 0 f = x AC ÎH0 f (BC), in kJ (g-atom)â1. In general, the dependence of H0 f,cc = f (Î H Ì 0 f ) has a minimum, its branches being described with the help of linear equations (the average deviation from the known ÎH 0 f,cc values was less than Â± 4.7% for 121 double compounds in 34 systems). A conclusion has been drawn that these regularities (linear approximation rule â LAR) are characteristic for different types of inorganic double compound.",1
"To improve the corrosion resistance of steel wires, a uniform thin layer of bulk metallic glass alloy with different compositions of (Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5)100-x Nb x (x=0, 3, 5, 8 at%) was coated on the surface of Q195 steel wires by a newly developed continuous coating process. Phase analysis results show that the coating is mainly composed of metallic glass alloy and some other intermetallics. The potentiodynamic polarization tests indicate that the steel wires with metallic glass coating show passivation behavior, and have higher pitting potential and lower corrosion current density than Q195 steel wires. With the increment of Nb content, the passivation region of the metallic glass-coated steel wires become wider while pitting potential is increased. As shown in composition analysis results, it may be attributed to the addition of Nb which has properties of easy passivation and stabilizing the passivation elements of Zr and Ti",0
"We propose a method to study the magnetic properties of a disordered Ising kagome lattice. The model considers small spin clusters with infinite-range disordered couplings and short-range ferromagnetic (FE) or antiferromagnetic interactions. The correlated cluster mean-field theory is used to obtain an effective single-cluster problem. A finite disorder intensity in FE kagome lattice introduces a cluster spin-glass (CSG) phase. Nevertheless, an infinitesimal disorder stabilizes the CSG behavior in the geometrically frustrated kagome system. Entropy, magnetic susceptibility and spinâspin correlation are used to describe the interplay between disorder and geometric frustration (GF). We find that GF plays an important role in the low-disorder CSG phase. However, the increase of disorder can rule out the effect of GF.",0
"Microstructure, mechanical properties and toughening mechanisms of hot-pressed SiC whiskers (SiCw) reinforced ZrO2 (2 mol% Y2O3) based composites were investigated by using TEM, SEM and XRD techniques and mechanical tests. It was shown that the Vickers hardness, elastic modulus, fracture toughness and flexural strength of ZrO2(2Y) ceramics are obviously improved by the addition of SiCw. TEM observations showed that whiskers and the ZrO2 matrix are bonded tightly and there is no obvious second phase formed on the SiCw/ZrO2 interface. Both whisker toughening and transformation toughening are effective in ZrO2 (2mol% Y2O2) ceramics so that a good combination of high strength and high fracture toughness can be obtained.",0
"Rare earth (Er3+ and Nd3+) ions doped cadmium lithium boro tellurite (CLiBT) glasses were prepared by melt quenching method. The visâNIR absorption spectra of these glasses have been analyzed systematically. JuddâOfelt intensity parameters Î© Î» (Î»Â =Â 2, 4, 6) have been evaluated and used to compute the radiative properties of emission transitions of Er3+ and Nd3+: CLiBT glasses. From the NIR emission spectra of Er3+: CLiBT glasses a broad emission band centered at 1538Â nm (4I13/2Â âÂ 4I15/2) is observed and from Nd3+: CLiBT glasses, three NIR emission bands at 898Â nm (4F3/2Â âÂ 4I9/2), 1070Â nm (4F3/2Â âÂ 4I11/2) and 1338Â nm (4F3/2Â âÂ 4I13/2) are observed with an excitation wavelength Î» exci Â =Â 514.5Â nm (Ar+ Laser). The FWHM and stimulated emission cross-section values are calculated for Er3+ and Nd3+: CLiBT glasses. FWHMÂ ÃÂ Ï e P values are also calculated for Er3+: CLiBT glasses.",1
"An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the effect of notch on flexural (quasi-static and fatigue) performance of Twill E-Glass/Epoxy composite. Standard specimens and specimens with different types of notches configuration such as circular holes, transverse ellipse, longitudinal ellipse and slot geometry, have been prepared from plates and are considered for the study. Displacement-controlled bending fatigue tests with stress ratio R of 0.10 have been conducted on the selected specimens and damage in the composite has been continuously monitored through the decrement of bending moment during cycling. SâN curves are generated for the targeted composite material by cycling the coupons until failure and recording the number of cycles-to-failure. The results of un-notched specimens are then compared with those of coupons which have the selected notch geometries. Besides, the residual mechanical properties (flexural strength) of the material have been measured after loading the specimens to a preset number of cycles for coupon loaded at 30% and 45% of the Average Failure Load (AFL). The results are used to compare the rate of material degradation among the different type of notches. Finally, it is observed that different notched geometry behave differently for quasi-static and fatigue loading. For composite component subjected to quasi-static load, the failure is mainly governed by stress concentration (local failure) i.e. the notch size is not a significant factor. Whereas for composite component subjected to fatigue loading, the notch size becomes a dominant factor for failure and results to be more relevant than the stress concentration.",0
"The phase transition in vortex system for porous glass with gallium in the superconducting state was studied using a SQUID magnetometer. The temperature hysteresis and asymmetry of magnetic behavior relatively to cooling and warming were observed, the irreversibility line coincided with the upper temperature bound of the phase transition. A qualitative explanation for the phase transition features is suggested.",1
"Different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0mol%) of Er3+-doped lead telluroborate glasses were prepared by conventional melt quenching method. Up on 514.5nm laser excitation, the near infrared luminescence due to the 4I13/2â4I15/2 transition was analyzed. The absorption and emission spectra were used to determine the different spectroscopic parameters by means of the JuddâOfelt and the McCumber theories. The obtained JuddâOfelt intensity parameters were used to obtain the radiative transition probability, fluorescence branching ratio and radiative lifetime of the 4I13/2 emission state. The effect of Er3+ concentration on the emission intensity of 4I13/2â4I15/2 transition was discussed. The Stark-level energies of 4I13/2 excited and 4I15/2 ground states were evaluated using both the absorption and emission measurements. The wavelength dependent gain coefficient, G(Î») of 4I13/2â4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ion was determined using the absorption and emission cross-sections. The suitability of this glass as a host for Er3+-doped broad-band amplifiers and its advantage over other glasses were discussed.",1
"We report the Raman spectroscopic characterization of a SNAB glass system doped with neodymium and CdS nanocrystals and fabricated by the fusion process. Raman spectra revealed CdS nanocrystals in the glass host and bands associated with SiâO vibrational modes with five structural configurations, boroxol modes of B2O3, AlâO and CdâS vibrational modes. Additionally, Nd2O3 modifies the growth of CdS nanocrystals in the SNAB glass and Nd3+ ions are not incorporated inside the semiconductor nanocrystals.",1

"AC susceptibility, magnetization and electrical resistivity around the Curie temperature (T c) were measured for Fe15Ni65B18Si2 glass. The results yield T c = (307.6Â±0.1) K and the following critical exponents Î³ = 1.50Â±0.03, Î² = 0.375Â±0.01, Î´ = 5.1Â±0.1 and Î± = -0.29Â±0.05. These values were obtained in the reduced temperature interval 1Ã10-3 â©½ |TâTc| Tc âª5 Ã10-2 . In spite of the fact that these values for the critical exponents were obtained from different measurements they obey the equality relations Î³ = Î²(Î´â1) and Î³+2Î²+Î± = 2. Reduced magnetisation and field follow a magnetic equation of state derived for a second-order phase transition over a wide temperature range. This set of critical exponents is compared with those derived from the Heisenberg model as well as with the usual ones for a pure crystalline ferromagnets. The comparison shows that the values of |Î±| and Î³, for our alloy, are considerably larger than those from the model and the usual crystalline ones. A similar difference is also observed in some other amorphous and dilute crystalline ferromagnets and is probably due to magnetic inhomogeneities.",0
"The dc conductivities of rapidly quenched mixed alkali glasses were compared with those of annealed glasses. The conductivities of the rapidly quenched glasses were higher but the extent of the mixed alkali effect at room temperature was not reduced by rapid quenching. This observation does not support a defect mechanism, such as the weak electrolyte model, as the mechanism of the mixed alkali effect.",1
"Anomalous values of Debye temperature have been obtained from recoil free factor measurements GeâSeâAg glasses recently [B. Arcondo, M.A. Urena, A. Piarristeguy, A. Pradel, M. Fontana, Physica B 389 (2007) 77]. In the present paper we show that this anomaly may arise due to the presence of anharmonic potential at the high spin ferrous site. We use q Lamb Mossbauer factor and anharmonic Lamb Mossbauer factor to study this anharmonicity.",1
"High performance broadband antireflective (AR) and water-repellent coatings were fabricated on glass substrates by assembly of silica nanoparticles and polyelectrolytes via the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique, followed by calcination and hydrophobic modification. A porous poly(diallyladimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)/20nm SiO2 nanoparticles (S-20) multilayer coating with AR property was prepared first. The maximum transmittance is as high as 99.0%, while that of the glass substrate is only 91.3%. After calcination and hydrophobic modification, the coating became water-repellent while maintaining the good AR property. Such water-repellent AR coatings can improve the short-circuit current of solar cells as much as 6.6% in comparison with glass substrates without the coatings. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology and thickness of coatings. Transmission spectra and reflection spectra were characterized by UVâvis spectrophotometer. The surface wettability was studied by a contact angle/interface system.",0
"Rotating frame 1H spin-lattice relaxation measurements in partially deuterated and non-deuterated glycerol in the super-cooled liquid to glass transition region are presented and compared with 2H results. Unlike proton spin-lattice relaxation in a laboratory Zeeman field, the data are shown to be sensitive to the crossover from quasi-ergodic to non-ergodic behavior near the calorimetric glass transition temperature.",0
"FeAl intermetallic compound with different contents of rare earth oxide La2O3 addition was prepared by hot pressing the mechanically alloyed powders. Effect of La2O3 on microstructure and high-temperature wear property of the sintered FeAl samples was investigated in this paper. The results showed that 1 wt.% La2O3 addition could refine the microstructure and increase the density of the FeAl intermetallic compound, and correspondingly improved the high-temperature wear resistance. SEM and EDS analyses of the worn surface indicated that micro-ploughing and local melting combined with oxidation were the dominant wear mechanisms.",0
"Series of (90% â x) TeO2 â 10% TiO2 â x Bi2O3 (xÂ =Â 0, 5 and 10Â mol %) tellurite laser glasses doped by Yb2O3 were prepared. The spectroscopic properties were characterized by the Raman spectrum, absorption spectrum and the fluorescence decay curves, respectively. The research achievements show that with the increase of Bi2O3, the emission cross-section increases from 1.20 to 1.31Â pm2, the fluorescence lifetime decreases from 0.68 to 0.65Â ms firstly, and then increases to 0.70Â ms. These properties show that the system of 80% TeO2-10% TiO2-10% Bi2O3 glasses may have potential be used as Yb2O3 doped large emission cross-section gain medium for solid laser.",1
"This paper reports on an investigation of glued joints in glass load-bearing structures, with reference to the effect of various substrates (glass, steel, stainless steel, aluminium) and their surface treatment (sandblasting for the glass surface) on the adhesion of selected adhesives. The thickness of the adhesive layer and the effect of artificial ageing â a simulation of 5 years of ageing in outdoor central-European conditions â are also discussed. Tensile and shear tests were carried out on three series of specimens with various adhesives and substrates â two series for tensile and shear tests, and one series for shear tests on specimens exposed to ageing. Our results show that sandblasting the glass surface can improve the adhesion, and thus the strength values, of an adhesive joint in cases where, with a smooth glass surface, cohesive failure is not reached. The thickness of the adhesive layer had a significant effect for a semi-rigid acrylate adhesive, where the joint achieved higher strength values with less thickness of the glue. The effect of ageing varied according to the adhesive. The most visible changes were observed for a two-component acrylate adhesive and for methacrylate UV-adhesives. One of the selected glues was marked as unsuitable for load-bearing connections due to significant worsening of its mechanical properties after ageing.",0
"Spectroscopic properties of Er3+-doped Na2OâSb2O3âB2O3âSiO2 glasses have been investigated for developing 1.5-Î¼m broadband fiber amplifiers. An intense 1.5-Î¼m near infrared emission with a broad full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 88nm has been obtained for Er3+-doped 5Na2Oâ20Sb2O3â35B2O3â40SiO2 glass upon excitation with a 980nm laser diode. The obtained emission cross-section of the 4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transition and the lifetime of the 4I13/2 level of Er3+ ions are 6.8Ã10â21 cm2 and 0.36ms, respectively. It is noted that the product of the emission cross-section and the FWHM of the glass, Ï e ÃFWHM, is as great as 598.4Ã10â21 cm2 nm, which is comparable or higher than that of Er3+-doped bismuth-based and tellurite-based glasses. These special optical properties encourage in identifying them as important materials for potential applications in high performance optics and optical communication networks.",1
"In magnetic measurements on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Î´ (Bi-2212) single crystals, a general peak with a dynamical feature on both SâH and SâT curves was found with S the magnetic relaxation rate. At higher fields, the characteristic exponent Î¼, becomes negative, together with the positive curvature of logE vs. logj and the scaling based on the 2D vortex glass (VG) theory or plastic creep theory, we conclude that the vortex motion above the second peak is plastic when jâ0 and there is no VG phase at finite temperatures in Bi-2212. The peak of S is then explained as the crossover between different meta-stable vortex states.",0
"Gd3+-doped borosilicate glasses are prepared in different melting atmosphere. Absorption spectra, decay time, luminescence spectra under UV and X-ray excitation are investigated. With melting atmosphere changing from air to CO, the luminescence intensities of Gd3+ at 313nm under the excitation of UV and X-ray are both enhanced. This mainly results from the reduction of Gd3+, which is validated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The optimal Gd2O3 content for the glasses prepared under CO atmosphere is 7.5mol%, whose integral scintillation efficiency is 20% compared with Bi4Ge3O12.",1
"5MgOâ9BaOâ33B2O3â33Al2O3â20SiO2 (mol%) glass was prepared by the melt quenching method at 1823K for 2h. Dilatometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of the glass have been investigated. Fragility index F was used to estimate glass formability. The crystallization kinetics of the glass was described by the activation energy (E) for crystallization and numerical factors (n, m) depending on the nucleation process and growth morphology. XRD and SEM analysis were also used to describe the crystalsâ types and morphology precipitated from the MgOâBaOâB2O3âAl2O3âSiO2 glass. The results show that the effective activation energy of the crystallization process E was 45.19kJ/mol, and n up to 4.05. Two crystals phases, i.e. Al4B2O9 and Al20B4O36 were observed in the crystallized samples. SEM results were consistent with crystallization kinetics.",1

"The present work reports the absorption, photoluminescence and decay properties of singly doped Dy3+ and co-doped Dy3+/Tm3+ ions in TeO2+ZnO+K2O+CaO (TZKC) glasses prepared by the melt quenching technique. The glassy nature of the host glass has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis and the primary vibrational modes were determined from the Raman spectrum. JuddâOfelt (JO) analysis has been used to calculate the radiative transition rates, branching ratios and radiative lifetime of the emitting 4F9/2 state. The effect of co-doping of different concentrations of Tm3+ ions on the emission properties of Dy3+ ions has been investigated. The decay profiles of the 4F9/2 level were fitted to double exponential as well as InokutiâHirayama (IH) model to determine the energy transfer rates between Dy3+ and Tm3+ ions. The energy transfer rates found to increase with the increase of Tm3+ ions concentration. The chromaticity coordinates and color purity of the emitted light for all glasses were determined.",1
"Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped SiO2âAl2O3âAlF3-Gd2O3âNa2O glass with different F/O ratios were prepared. The effect of F/O ratio on the structure and optical properties of the glasses was investigated. The amorphous nature of the glasses was determined by XRD, and the glass transition temperature (T g) and the crystallization peak temperature (T c) were obtained from the DSC curves. The change in the structure of the glass network was analyzed by infrared spectroscopy. The density and absorption spectra of the bulk glass was also investigated. The excitation spectrum, emission spectrum and 4S3/2 level fluorescence lifetime of Er3+ ions in the glasses were tested by a Xenon lamp with adjustable wavelength. The up-conversion luminescence spectrum of Er3+ ions was measured under excitation of a 980Â nm laser. The results show that the green (2H11/2, 4S3/2) and red (4F9/2) up-conversion luminescence intensity is the highest when the F/O ratio is 0.214. According to the variation law of up-conversion luminescence intensity and pump power, it is confirmed that the up-conversion green (2H11/2Â âÂ 4I15/2, 4S3/2Â âÂ 4I15/2) and red (4F9/2Â âÂ 4I15/2) light of Er3+ ions are the three-photon absorption process based on excited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer up-conversion (ETU) mechanism. Finally, energy transfer transitions between Er3+ and Yb3+ are also analyzed. The CIE chromaticity coordinates were calculated from the emission spectrum obtained at two different excitation wavelengths of 378Â nm and 980Â nm.",1
"Ultraviolet light-induced spectral change in one Eu3+ doped aluminosilicate glass was studied. It was observed that the excited charge-transfer band decreased after irradiation. The intensity at the irradiated site decreased linearly with the power density of the irradiation light. This means that the light-induced change is a one-photon process. Irradiations at different wavelengths indicate that the spectral change is frequency-selective. The dark decay of the spectral change was also studied. At least two time constants were obtained. One constant is â¼2.5 h, and the other is longer.",1
"Tm3+/Al3+ co-doped silica glass was prepared by solâgel method combined with high temperature sintering. Glasses with compositions of xTm2O3â15xAl2O3â(100â16x) SiO2 (in mol%, x =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0) were prepared. The high thulium doped silica glass was realized. Their spectroscopic parameters were calculated and analyzed by JuddâOfelt theory. Large absorption cross section (4.65Ã10â21 cm2 at 1668nm) and stimulated emission cross section (6.00Ã10â21 cm2 at 1812nm), as well as low hydroxyl content (0.180cmâ1), long fluorescence lifetime (834Î¼s at 1800nm), large Ï em Ã Ï rad (30.05Ã10â21 cm2 ms) and large relative intensity ratio of the 1.8Î¼m (3F4 â 3H6) to 1.46 (3H4 â 3F4) emissions (90.33) are achieved in this Tm3+/Al3+ co-doped silica glasses. According to emission characteristics, the optimum thulium doping concentration is around 0.8mol%. The cross relaxation (CR) between ground and excited states of Tm3+ ions was used to explain the optimum thulium doping concentration. These results suggest that the solâgel method is an effective way to prepare Tm3+ doped silica glass with high Tm3+ doping and prospective spectroscopic properties.",1
"In this paper, the effects of resin content on the wear of woven roving glass fibreâepoxy resin and glass fibreâpolyester resin composite materials have been examined. Furthermore, composite materials are experimentally investigated under different loads and speeds by using a block-on-shaft wear tester. The influences of two thermosetting resins epoxy and polyester on the wear of glass-woven roving reinforced composites under has been investigated dry conditions. The glass fibreâepoxy resin and the glass fibreâpolyester resin composite materials specimens have been tested under different experiment conditions. Tests were conducted for 0.39 and 0.557m/s speeds, at two different loads of 5 and 10N. The weight losses were measured after measuring different sliding distances. Wear in the experiments was determined as weight loss. For each experiment, one specimen was used. The amount of wear was measured before the experiment and after the experiment with the apparatus of balance scales with the accuracy of 10â3 g. Glass fibreâepoxy resin composites generally showed higher strength and minimum wear when compared with glass fibreâpolyester resin composites materials. In addition, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to study the worn surface to verify the results.",0
"Micro flash butt welding of super duplex stainless steel with Zr-based metallic glass insert was carried out. Zr55Cu30Ni5Al10 of Zr-based metallic glass with thickness of 50Î¼m and Zr metal with thickness of 500Î¼m were used as the insert materials. After welding, Zr-based metallic glass insert became much thinner than that of Zr metal insert. The supercooled liquid of Zr-based metallic glass insert at the interface was protruded outside of the specimen during welding. The formation of the protrusion discharged the oxide films on the butting surfaces and contact surface, resulting in metallurgical bonding through the fresh surfaces. The FeâZr metallic compounds were observed at the bonding interface for the Zr metal insert, but the metallic compound for Zr-based metallic glass insert was hardly observed. The micro flash butt welding of stainless steel with Zr-based metallic glass insert was successfully welded.",0
"We have observed a several times enhancement of the optical second harmonic generation in newly synthesized Europium doped PbOâBi2O3âGa2O3âBaO glasses for the fundamental wavelength 1320nm during optical treatment by coherent fundamental and doubled frequency beams with a pulse duration about 15ns. We have found that the maximal optical second harmonic generation was achieved for the Eu content of about 1.4% at fundamental beam average power equal to about 3GW/cm2 , temperature of about 300K and intensity ratio between the fundamental and doubled frequency beams of about 9. Frequency repetition of the optical pulses was equal to about 10Hz. It was shown that doping by other rare earth ions, particularly by Dysprosium does not give a sufficient contribution to the effect.",1
"In the current investigation, hybridization of glass fiber and Date Palm Leaf (DPL) fiber were used to modify the mechanical and thermal properties of epoxy composites. Mechanical behaviour of the epoxy composites were characterized by using tensile and flexural test. The results showed that significant improvement in mechanical properties by the addition of different weight percentage of DPL. Natural fibers were modified with alkaline treatment to improve fiber and matrix bonding. The fractured surface morphology of the epoxy hybrid composites were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Thermal properties of the composites were characterized using Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC). The result indicates that incorporation of DPL improved the thermal stability of the epoxy/glass fiber.",0
"Recently, we found that Ag-doped 30Li3PO4â70Al(PO3)3 glass shows radiophotoluminescence (RPL) and thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) properties. In this study, we investigated Ag concentration dependence of RPL and TSL in this new glass system. 0â1.0% Ag-doped 30Li3PO4â70Al(PO3)3 glasses were prepared by the melt quenching technique. The as-prepared samples show photoluminescence (PL) emission at 425nm under 340nm excitation. After X-ray irradiation, an additional PL emission can be observed around 630nm with the same excitation wavelength, and this emission is considered to be due to RPL. Among the samples tested, 0.5% and 1.0% Ag-doped samples are the most sensitive and show a linear RPL response over the dose range 0.1â20Gy. For TSL, the Ag-doped samples showed a glow peak around 350Â°C.In contrast, non-doped sample showed glow peaks at 370Â°C and above 490Â°C. The dose responses of all the samples exhibit a liner response in the dose range of 0.1â20Gy.",1
"In the present work, different concentrations of Sm3+doped strontium lithium bismuth borate glasses (SLBiB) have been prepared by melt quench technique and investigated their optical, structural and dielectric properties. The amorphous nature of the prepared glass samples was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and SEM analysis. The spectroscopic properties of these glasses were investigated by recording optical absorption, photoluminescence and decay curve analysis. JuddâOfelt (JâO) theory has been applied for the fâf transitions of Sm3+ ions to evaluate JâO intensity parameters, Î©Î» (Î» =2, 4 and 6). Using the JâO intensity parameters, radiative properties such as transition probabilities (A R), calculated branching ratios (Î²) and radiative lifetimes (Ï) are estimated. From the emission spectra, effective bandwidths (ÎÎ»eff ) and stimulated emission cross-sections (Ïp ) have been obtained for observed emission levels. From the emission spectra, a strong reddish-orange emission corresponding to the transition, 4G5/2 â 6H7/2 was observed. The nature of decay curves of 4G5/2 level for different Sm3+concentrations in SLBiB glass has been analyzed. FTIR spectra were recorded to analyze the functional groups present in the glass matrix. From the dielectric properties, variation of dielectric constant, dielectric loss and ac conductivity of Sm3+ doped different glass samples with the variation of frequency was studied.",1
"The qualitative effect of temperature on the particle entrainment rate has been measured in a gas fluidized bed (i.d. 0.1 m, height 1.97 m) equipped with an electric heater, using sand as the bed material. The mean particle size (0.091â0.363 mm), the gas velocity (0.65â2.3 m/s) and the bed temperature (20â600Â°C) were considered as experimental variables. As the temperature was increased, the particle entrainment rate was observed to decrease initially. However, above a certain temperature it began to increase for gas velocities between 0.8 and 1.4 m/s. The variation of the particle entrainment rate with temperature was similar to that of the particle size for which the terminal velocity is equal to the gas velocity.",0
"The effects of temperature and pressure on the ultrasonic propagation properties, dielectric constants and the Raman and Brillouin spectra in paratellurite (TeO2) were investigated with emphasis on the behavior in the vicinity of the newly-discovered, pressure-induced phase transition. The transition is found to be second-order and purely strain-induced, driven by a soft shear acoustic mode propagating along a <110ã and polarized along a (110) crystal direction. Such pure-strain transitions were previously discussed by Anderson and Blount and the transition in paratellurite is the first observation of this kind of transition. No evidence was found for any coupling of the soft mode to any other acoustic or optic mode, although small anomalies associated with lattice strains accompanying the transition were observed in some of the elastic and dielectric constants. Analysis of the effective elastic constant C, governing the soft mode velocity indicates that, within experimental uncertainty, the transition can be described by mean-field theory. Although the apparent attenuation of the soft mode increased significantly near the transition, it is concluded that this effect is probably due to the fact that the phase and group velocities are not parallel rather than to intrinsic dissipative processes in the crystal. With the exception of C44 , the remaining elastic constants and Raman-active phonon frequencies displayed normal increases with pressure. No soft Raman-active modes were observed in either phase. The static dielectric constants Ïµ1 are large, due to the large electronic polarizability of TeO2, and the anisotropy in Ïµ results almost entirely from the anisotropy in the optical dielectric constants Ïµâ. In the low pressure tetragonal phase both Ïµa and Ïµc exhibit normal temperature dependences and Ïµc decreases with pressure; however, Ïµa exhibits an anomalous increase with pressure. Temperature, pressure and uniaxial stress measurements are combined to evaluate the various contributions to the temperature and pressure dependences of Ïµ. Combining the Ïµ data with available i.r. measurements demonstrated that the generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation is well obeyed for TeO2. Finally, the Szigetti effective charge ratios were determined for the lowest frequency IR-active modes. These ratios were found to be quite low, being 0.27 and 0.18 for the a-axis responses, respectively, indicating that the bonding is highly covalent.",0
"Eu3+-doped and Eu3+,Y3+-codoped SiO2 glasses were prepared through solâgel technology. Effects of annealing on the spectroscopic properties, including photoluminescence, decay processes and spectral hole burning, were investigated. It was found that clusterization of Eu and EuâY may take place during the annealing process, and the environment of Eu ions was changed from a site of near inversion symmetry to one with more non-inversion character, resulting in an increase of the 5D0â5F2 transitions relative to that of the transitions to 5F0 and 5F1. The affects of clusterization on the spectroscopic properties are discussed.",1
"Tin dioxide (SnO2) thin films were deposited on quartz glass substrates by chemical vapor deposition using SnI2 and O2 as reactants. The growth experiments were carried out in the substrate temperature range of 300â900Â Â°C. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, spectrophotometry and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the films. The films were polycrystalline with their crystallites having a preferred orientation, which was dependent on the film thickness. The average grain size increased with increasing thickness of the films. The binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 and O 1s for all samples showed the Sn4+ and O-Sn4+ bonding state from SnO2. The absolute average transmittance of SnO2 films exceeded 90% in the visible and infrared range. The obtained SnO2 films had optical band gaps between 3.78 and 3.92Â eV.",0
"BaSn0.15Ti0.85O3 (BTS) ferroelectric thin films have been deposited on the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)/glass substrate by RF sputtering from a powder target, and the structural and electrical properties of the BTS film are also investigated at various deposition rates. The results indicate that leakage current of the BTS film is strongly related to the deposition rate, which decreases with increasing deposition rates. The leakage current density of the as-prepared film for a deposition rate of 40nm/min and thickness of 500nm is lower than 1.5Ã10â10 A/cm2, while its dielectric tunability reaches 57.3% and dielectric loss remains only 0.01 at a bias voltage of 5V. From SIMS depth profiling of as-prepared BTS films, the lower leakage current density of the BTS film at a faster deposition rate may be attributed to the sharper BTS/ITO interface with a low inter-diffusion that results from the high deposition rate and shorter deposition time.",1
"Hall resistivity ÏH and magnetoresistance ÎÏ/Ï0 in the spin-glass phase of a 3d transition-metal intercalation compound FexTiS2 (x = 0.20) have been measured over the temperature range 1.5â4.2 K and the time range 0.1â1000 s under pulsed magnetic fields up to 16 T. The ÏH-H and ÎÏ/Ï0-H curves show a hysteresis corresponding to the magnetization curve, and these quantities decay with time t after the pulsed field is switched off, obeying the algebraic dependence or power-law of the form, Ï H = At âm and | ÎÏ/Ï 0| = Bt ân , where the exponents m and n are found to be temperature dependent, in good agreement with those found for other spin-glass systems.",0
"Ultravioletâvisible absorption of undoped lithium disilicate glass reveals strong UV absorption and no visible bands could be identified. Such UV absorption is related to the presence of unavoidable trace iron impurities within raw materials used for the preparation of this glass. Optical absorption of the CuO-doped samples show an extra broad visible band centered at 780nm and in high CuO contents samples obvious splitting to several component peaks are observed. This characteristic visible absorption of copper-doped samples is correlated with the presence of Cu+2 ions in octahedral coordination with tetragonal distortion. Gamma irradiation of the prepared samples produces radiation-induced defects, which are related to the sharing of host lithium disilicate glass, trace iron impurities and copper iron in their formation. The visible spectrum of the CuO samples shows shielding effect towards successive gamma irradiation.",1
"Hall resistivity ÏH and magnetoresistance ÎÏ/Ï0 in the spin-glass phase of Fe x TiS2 (x = 0.20) have been measured at 4.2 K under pulsed magnetic fields up to 16 T. The ÏH- and ÎÏ/Ï0- H curves show a hysteresis corresponding to the magnetization curve, and these quantities relax with time t after the field is switched off, obeying the power law of the form, |ÎÏ/Ï0| =At âm (m = 0.0575) and ÏH-Bt ân (n = 0.0258).",0
"Tensile stiffness of a unidirectional glass fibre-epoxy laminate was found to be time-dependent, but to a degree which varied considerably with direction in the plane of the laminate. Consequently the rate of creep varied significantly with direction and the anisotropy with time.",0
"A new series of 0.4MgF2â0.4BaF2â0.1Al(PO3)3â0.1Ba(PO3)2 glasses doped with Yb3+ is introduced for fiber and waveguide laser applications. Spectroscopic properties including emission cross-section and lifetime and optical properties including refractive index, nonlinear refractive index, and Abbe number are reported as a function of Yb2O3 concentration. The refractive index n d is linearly dependent on Yb2O3 concentration, while the nonlinear refractive index, n 2 =1.42Ã10â13 esu, which is independent of Yb2O3 concentration, is extremely small. In addition, the Abbe number is remarkably high, >65, and is also independent of Yb2O3 concentration. To our knowledge, the emission cross-section Ï emi, which was found to be â¼0.87pm2 at the lasing wavelength of 996nm, is the highest one among fluorophosphate glasses. This glass exhibits an extremely high gain coefficient, G =0.95mspm4, and high quantum efficiency of Î· =94%. The combination of outstanding spectroscopic (high emission cross-section and gain coefficient) and optical (low dispersion and small nonlinear refractive index) properties demonstrates that the current Yb3+ activated fluorophosphate glass is an excellent candidate material for fiber and waveguide lasers.",1
"The addition of Al to a binary Zr75Ni25 alloy greatly increases the stabilization of the supercooled liquid as well as the glass-forming ability (GFA) in Zr75âx Ni25Al x (x =0â24) alloy series. The large supercooled liquid region (ÎTx ) of over 80K and critical sample diameter (d c) for glass formation above 12 mm were obtained in a wide composition range of x =11â19. The largest d c of 15mm was fabricated for an off-eutectic Zr60Ni25Al15 alloy, which has the largest ÎTx of 93K and Î³ value of 0.396. The bulk glassy alloys exhibited excellent mechanical properties, i.e., high compressive fracture strength of 1662â1958MPa and large compressive plastic strain of 3.0â4.7%.",0
"A large amount of free volume (FV) or the precipitation of ductile dendrites from the glass matrix generally leads to the enhanced plasticity of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). In this study, the structural relaxation enthalpy ÎH rel (the measure of FV amount) is found to increase after adding Nb or Fe to the glass matrix. As a result, a series of centimeter-scale plastic BMGs is fabricated. Among these TiZr-based BMGs, the sample (Ti32.8Zr30.2Cu9Ni5.3Be22.7)0.9Nb10 (at%) possesses the largest plastic strain (Îµ p) of 8.3% and ultimate strength (Ï max) of 2080MPa. By further precisely tailoring the composition, a TiZr-based BMG matrix composite (BMGMC) (Ti38.8Zr28.8Cu6.2Be16.2Nb10, at%) possessing both the precipitation of Î²-Ti and Î²-Zr dendrites simultaneously has been fabricated. The TiZr-based BMGMC has both the distinguished plastic strain (Îµ p) of 12% and ultimate strength (Ï max) of 2150MPa. The values of yielding strength (Ï y) significantly decreased with the increase of suction casting diameter, whereas the work-hardening phenomenon is more obvious. Therefore, a critical size and volume fractions corresponding to the best mechanical properties of TiZr-based BMGMC should exist. The ductile dendrites are crucial to impeding shear band propagation and generating multiple shear bands in the glass matrix. Results indicate that a large amount of lattice distortions, pile-ups of dislocations and shear steps can be attributed to distinguished plasticity, and these constitute the deformation mechanism of TiZr-based BMGMC.",0
"20Li2Oâ80TeO2 glasses were heat annealed at different temperatures between T g and T x and studied by using XRD, FTIR spectroscopy and DSC techniques to understand the crystallization kinetics in this glass matrix. The infrared band structure of this glass is similar to what was observed in glassy TeO2. XRD results reveal the presence of three distinct crystalline Î³-TeO2, Î±-TeO2 and Li2Te2O5 phases during the crystallization process. This is a first report of Î³-TeO2 phase crystallization in this glass matrix. DSC results confirm the crystallization of three distinct structures in the glass. In summary, our results suggest a crystallization hierarchy on this glass matrix since the Î³-TeO2 and Î±-TeO2 phases crystallization occurs before the Li2Te2O5 phase crystallization.",1
"Data of density, refractive index and thermal expansion coefficient for B2O3âSiO2 and GeO2âSiO2 glasses have been analyzed. The volumes of the structural units are the same found for the vitreous B2O3, GeO2 and SiO2. The volume of any structural unit is constant over the entire composition region of the glass system. The same has been found for the differential refraction and unit refraction of the structural units in these glasses. Different features are observed for the differential expansion of the structural units. There is a considerable change with composition in the differential expansion of BO3, GeO4 and SiO4 units. The effect is attributed to a change in the asymmetry of vibrations with the number of SiâOâB or SiâOâGe linkages in the matrix. The thermal expansion coefficient is mainly determined by the contribution of B2O3 or GeO2 in the concerned glasses.",1
"This paper reports on the spectral results of Sm3+ or Dy3+ (1.0mol%) ions-doped B2O3âZnOâPbO (BZP) glasses. Measurements of X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) profiles of these rare-earth ion-doped glasses have been carried out. From the DSC thermograms, glass transition (T g), crystallization (T c) and melting (T m) temperatures have been evaluated. Direct and indirect optical band gaps have been calculated based on the glasses UV absorption spectra. These glasses have shown strong absorption bands in the near-infrared (NIR) region and their oscillator strengths have been computed. Emission bands of 4G5/2â6H5/2 (564nm), 4G5/2â6H7/2 (602nm), 4G5/2â6H9/2 (647nm) and 4G5/2â6H11/2 (710nm) for the Sm3+: glass, with excitation at 6H5/2â4I9/2 (484nm) have been recorded. Of them, 4G5/2â 6H7/2 (602nm) has shown a bright emission. With regard to the Dy3+: glass, a bright fluorescent yellow emission at 576nm (4F9/2â6H13/2) has been observed, apart from 4F9/2â6H15/2 (484nm) and 4F9/2â6H11/2 (666nm) emission transitions with excitation at 450nm (6H15/2â4I15/2) excitation wavelength. Stimulated emission cross-sections of all the emission bands of Sm3+ and Dy3+: BZP glasses have been computed based on their measured ÎÎ» (FWHM) and measured lifetimes (Ï m).",1
Fe67Co9.5Nd3Dy0.5B20 glassy powders have been consolidated by uniaxial hot pressing in the supercooled liquid state. The compact obtained by hot pressing at 833 K has high relative densities of over 99.0% and keeps a glassy single phase. The bulk compact exhibits good hard magnetic properties after annealing for 600 s at 913 K.,0
"For the MgâSnâAl alloys, the ultimate strength (UTS) of an extruded Mgâ9wt.%Alâ2wt.%Sn alloy reached 390MPa. TEM observation indicated that plate-like Mg17Al12 precipitates having Burgers orientation relationship with the matrix are responsible for the strength. This alloy also exhibits an age hardening behavior: the peak hardness appears after 15â20h of heat treatment at 473K. On the other hand, the UTS of the MgâMgâSnâZn alloys are on the order of 300MPa. The precipitates in these alloys are composed of the Mg2Sn and MgZn2 particles. It was found that these phases often precipitate together, suggesting that the MgZn2 phase can act as a nucleation sites for Mg2Sn.",0
"Normally, monolithic bulk metallic glasses exhibit poor ductility (<1%) at room temperature through inhomogeneous plastic deformation. Only a few compositions are found so far showing some ductility but their deformation mechanism is still poorly understood. In this letter, a Zr-based bulk metallic glass is presented showing the ductility of 12%. It was observed that loops of material flow are created on shear plane in the initial stages of deformation while river pattern emerges out of these loops in the later stages of deformation. It was also investigated that the intersectioning of shear bands leads to the ductile behavior as well as irregular serrated behavior in stress-strain curve for the alloy.",0
"Energy transfer mechanisms and the effect of Tm3+ addition on the intensity of the Dy3+:2.9 Î¼m emission from Ge25Ga5S70 glass were investigated. Intensity of the 2.9 Î¼m fluorescence from Dy3+ increased with increasing Tm3+ content when the Dy3+ concentration remained constant, which indicates the presence of an efficient energy transfer between Tm3+ and Dy3+. A decrease in the measured lifetimes of the Tm3+:3F4 level and a wide spectral overlap between the Tm3+:1.8 Î¼m emission and the absorption of Dy 3+:6 H 15 2 â 6 H 11 2 also supported the proposed energy transfer scheme. Analyses of the emission intensities and decay times suggested that a direct energy transfer from the Tm3+:3F4 level to Dy 3+:6 H 11 2 level occurred after a fast diffusion-limited migration of the excitation energy among Tm3+.",1
Conduction mechanism in Fe2O3 doped Na2OÂ·Bi2O3Â·B2O3 semiconducting glass system was studied in frequency range 10Hz to 1MHz and at temperatures between room temperature and 663K. The total conductivity spectrum follows universal power law with frequency exponent âsâ value less than unity and lies in the range 0.51â¤sâ¤0.78. These ranges of âsâ values indicate that the carrier transport is predominately due to hopping electrons between charged defects and show temperature dependence as predicted by correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model. The change in activation energy of dc conductivity with temperature reveals the change in conduction mode from small polaron hopping (SPH) at high temperatures (T>Î¸ D/2) to variable range hopping (VRH) at low temperatures (T<Î¸ D/2). The range of density of states at Fermi level N (EF)=7.25Ã1021â1.32Ã1021 eVâ1 cmâ3 at temperatures below Î¸ D/2 corresponds to localized states near Fermi level. The large values of activation energy W 2 (0.067â0.155eV) dominated the conduction may results in high range of temperature (T=503â 423K) for variable-range hopping conduction in these glasses.,1

"The Kauzmann paradox is elucidated considering the intraband and interband fluctuation entropies. The intraband fluctuation entropy negatively diverges at the Kauzmann temperature in the form of the Curie law, but the interband fluctuation entropy crosses at the liquidâglass transition temperature and defends from the entropy crisis. The specific heat due to the intraband fluctuation entropy increases in the squared form of the Curie law till the glass transition as the temperature decreases; the contribution of fragile liquids is larger than that of strong liquids. The specific heat of sound and phonons is also calculated.",0
"The effect of Nb micro-addition on the glass-forming ability, magnetic and corrosion properties of (Fe0.76Si0.09B0.1P0.05)100âx Nb x (x =0â4) alloy system was investigated. It was found that micro-addition of 1% Nb is effective in increasing the critical diameter for glass formation from 2.5 for the base alloy to 3.5mm for (Fe0.76Si0.09B0.1P0.05)99Nb1 glassy alloy. Moreover, the 1% Nb-containing glassy alloy exhibits excellent soft-magnetic properties, i.e., high saturation magnetization (I s) of 1.45T and low coercive force (H c) of 1A/m. A significant improvement in corrosion resistance of the glassy alloys with Nb micro-alloying in 1N H2SO4 solution is also observed. The good combination of high glass-forming ability (GFA), excellent soft-magnetic properties and enhanced corrosion resistance indicates the possibility of future development as new engineering and functional materials.",0
"Two different experimental approaches were combined to study the electric dipole strength in the doubly-magic nucleus 48Ca below the neutron threshold. Real-photon scattering experiments using bremsstrahlung up to 9.9 MeV and nearly mono-energetic linearly polarized photons with energies between 6.6 and 9.51 MeV provided strength distribution and parities, and an ( Î± , Î± â² Î³ ) experiment at E Î± = 136 MeV gave cross sections for an isoscalar probe. The unexpected difference observed in the dipole response is compared to calculations using the first-order random-phase approximation and points to an energy-dependent isospin character. A strong isoscalar state at 7.6 MeV was identified for the first time supporting a recent theoretical prediction.",0
"A series of Zr35âxTi30Cu7.5Be27.5Fex (x=0â10) bulk metallic glasses are cast using water-cooled copper mold casting technique. The glass forming ability (GFA) and thermal stability of Zr35âxTi30Cu7.5Be27.5Fex alloys were studied by means of X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the Zr35âxTi30Cu7.5Be27.5Fex (x=2, 3, 5 and 7, respectively) alloys could be cast into glassy cylindrical rods with a diameters up to 20mm. However, higher Fe content (x=10) deteriorates the GFA remarkably. The supercooled liquid region (ÎTx), Î³ parameter (defined as Tx/(Tg +Tl)) and the reduced glass transition temperature Trg (defined as Tg/Tl) are employed to evaluate the GFA in Zr35âxTi30Cu7.5Be27.5Fex (x=0â10) alloys. The results showed that Trg was more effective in gauging the GFA of the Zr35âxTi30Cu7.5Be27.5Fex alloy systems than ÎTx and Î³ parameter. In addition, elastic constant (Poissonâs ratio) was also employed as a gauge to evaluate the glass forming ability in Zr35âxTi30Cu7.5Be27.5Fex alloys.",0
"In this paper, new Ho3+/Yb3+ co-doped fluorophosphate glasses with superior thermal stability against crystallization have been synthesized. Intense 2Î¼m emissions have been observed when pumped by a conventional 980nm laser diode. High infrared transmittance (82%) and low hydroxyl concentration (16.7ppm) can be realized according to the analysis of infrared transmittance spectrum.

Besides, the energy transfer coefficients from Yb3+ to Ho3+ have also been calculated and discussed. The results suggest the prepared glass is a good candidate for efficient 2Î¼m laser.",1
"The crystallization kinetics of Cu38Zr46Ag8Al8 bulk metallic glass in non-isothermal mode and isothermal mode are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. In non-isothermal conditions, the average value of activation energy is determined by Kissinger equation, and the value is around 310kJ/mol. The crystallization enthalpy is about 28.69J/g. In addition, the local Avrami exponent is adopted to describe the crystallization process. In isothermal route, the average value of activation energy for crystallization is calculated by the Arrhenius equation, and the value is about 451kJ/mol. The crystallization enthalpy is about 1.63J/g. And the Avrami exponent n ranges from 4.10 to 4.74, which indicates that the crystallization mechanism is mainly governed by constant nucleation rate. The created phases in the two conditions are different which can be confirmed by the X-ray diffraction test, this result is in accordance with the different crystallization enthalpies, but it's different with other investigations.",0
"The glass-forming ability (GFA) of TiâZrâBe ternary alloys is dramatically improved by partially replacing Be with Ni. Centimeter-scale fully amorphous samples can be obtained in a wide Ni content range of 4at.%â12at.%. In particular, some of the developed TiâZrâBeâNi alloys exhibit a critical diameter up to 20mm, which is larger than that of other quaternary Ti-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Moreover, Ni addition also enhances the yield strength and compressive plastic strain of TiâZrâBe alloys obviously. Based on the experimental results, the effect of substituting elements addition on the glass-forming ability of TiâZrâBe alloys has been systematically investigated and an empirical composition design method for the development of novel Ti-based BMGs with large GFA has been proposed.",0
"Highly ordered nanoporous alumina structure was fabricated with a solution pretreatment method and a time-efficient anodization process and, this structure was tested as a template for the electrochemical synthesis of metal oxides, Cu2O and ZnO. Cathodic electrodeposition of oxides inside pores was retarded because of the variation of pore structure caused by the pH increase, but nano-thin oxide films was formed at pore mouth.",0
"A Er3+/Tm3+ co-doped silicate glass with good thermal stability is prepared by melt-quenching method. An efficient emission of â¼2Î¼m is observed under different selective laser excitations. The optical absorption and transmission spectra, Raman spectra, and emission spectra are tested to characterize â¼2Î¼m emission properties of Er3+/Tm3+ co-doped silicate glasses and a reasonable energy transfer mechanism of â¼2Î¼m emission between Er3+ and Tm3+ ions is proposed. Based on the optical absorption spectra, the JuddâOfelt parameters and radiative properties were calculated. Intense â¼2Î¼m emission is obtained from Er3+/Tm3+ co-doped silicate glasses due to the efficient energy transfer from Er3+ to Tm3+ ions. The energy transfer coefficient from Er3+ to Tm3+ ions can reach as high as 13.39Ã10â40 cm6/s. In addition, the population of the OH groups is decreased and the â¼2Î¼m emission is effectively enhanced with fluoride introduction. The emission property, together with good thermal property, indicates that Er3+/Tm3+ co-doped silicate glass is a potential kind of laser glass for efficient â¼2Î¼m laser.",1
"A kind of novel silicate glasses doped with Tm3+ sensitized by Yb3+ were prepared by conventional melt quenching method. The optical properties of the synthesized glasses were theoretically and experimentally investigated. Based on the absorption spectra and the Judd-Ofelt theory, the J-O intensity parameters (Î©t), radiative transition probability (400.4sâ1), fluorescence lifetime (4.99ms) and absorption and emission cross sections (Ïe =2.51Ã10â20 cm2) were calculated. According to fluorescence spectra, the 1.8Î¼m emission of Tm3+ could be greatly enhanced by adding proper amount of Yb3+ under the excitation of 980nm and the optimized concentration ratio of Tm3+ and Yb3+ was found to be 1:3 in the present silicate glass system. Besides, the energy transfer mechanism between Yb3+ and Tm3+ were thoroughly discussed. With the assistance of Yb3+, the lifetime of Tm3+ from 0.54ms increased to 1.42ms. The energy transfer efficiency from Yb3+ to Tm3+ could reach 90.94%, and the energy transfer coefficient was 5.43Ã10â41 cm6/s. The content of OHâ was measured. The above results showed that Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doping could be expected to a promising way to achieve high efficient 2Î¼m lasing pumped by a 980nm LD.",1
"The glass and glass-ceramics samples with composition of 50SiO2â10AlF3â(30âx)BaF2â5TiO2â3.95LaF3â xMnCO3â0.05ErF3â1YbF3 (in mol%, x=0, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2) were prepared using the conventional quenching techniques. The effects of Mn2+ ions on the enhancement red upconversion emission of Mn2+/Er3+/Yb3+ tri-doped transparent glass-ceramics under the changing of heat treatment temperatures and concentrations of Mn2+ ions were investigated. The structural investigation carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy evidenced the formation of cubic Ba2LaF7 nanocrystals.

"The compositional dependence of the glass forming ability (GFA) and the correlation between their GFA and the GFA-related parameters of the CeâAlâCo(Cu) alloys were investigated. Rapidly quenched ribbons with compositions of Ce65AlxCo35âx (x=5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 27), Ce70AlxCo30âx (x=2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17) alloys, Ce70AlxCu30âx (x=5, 7, 10, 13, 17) and Ce90âxAl10Cux (x=15, 20, 25, 30) alloys, were prepared by melting spinning, respectively, and their phase transformations were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measurements. The experimental results indicated that the GFA of alloys Ce65AlxCo35âx (x=5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 27) increased with the increasing Al content from 5at.% to 27at.%. The GFA of Ce70AlxCo30âx (x=2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17) alloy ribbons decreased with the increasing Al content from 2at.% to 17at.%.

"CuI embedded in borosilicate glasses are prepared by a melt and heat-treatment method. We obtain the free carrier absorption cross section Ï â1.0Ã10â17 cm2 and the two-photon absorption coefficient Î² â0.14cm/GW by means of the Z-scan method using 6-ns laser pulses at 532nm, with an irradiation I 0 â16MW/cm2. Upon excitation with 355nm laser pulses at room temperature, very bright luminescence is observed, while the peak position shifts to lower energy as the band gap of CuI decreased by crystal growth. We also observed that the peak intensity varies linearly with the input intensity. The results could be attributed to the radiative recombination associated with traps or defects from impurities in the CuI microcrystallites.",0
Energy upconversion of Eu3+ is demonstrated in a solâgel processed silica glass co-doped with Yb3+ ions. Yellowâorange emission is observed originating from the Eu3+ ions due to nonresonant cooperative energy transfer from pairs of excited Yb3+ ions when a diode laser emitting at a wavelength of 973 nm is used as an excitation source. The Yb3+âEu3+ energy transfer rate is estimated as â¼280 sâ1 based on an analysis of the Yb3+ infrared luminescence decay time.,1
"Green and red up-conversion luminescence spectra corresponding to 2H11/2,4S3/2 â 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 â 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions in Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped lead-free fluorogermanate glasses have been examined as a function of Yb3+ concentration and temperature. The green-to-red luminescence intensity ratio diminishes with increasing Yb3+ concentration. The luminescence intensity ratio for bands related to the 2H11/2 â 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 â 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ was determined and temperature sensitivity parameters were calculated. The maximal temperature sensitivities for Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped glass samples increase with increasing Yb3+ concentration and the highest value of 42.5Ã10â4Kâ1 at room temperature was obtained for 0.5Er-3Yb system.

"(Ba,Sr)TiO3 (BST)-based ferroelectric glass-ceramic powders with different BaOâSiO2âB2O3 glass content, ranging from 0 to 30mol%, were prepared by a solâgel process. The crystalline structure and morphology were studied by XRD and SEM, respectively. The temperature dependence of dielectric constant and loss (Îµ â T), dielectric constant versus applied dc field (CâV) was measured for the BST glass-ceramics. Effects of doping glass on the structures and the dielectric characteristics of the BST glass-ceramics were discussed. Experimental results show that the BST glass-ceramics with pure perovskite phase can be well sintered at a lower temperature compared to the conventional BST ceramics.

"The effect of temperature on the luminescence intensity of up-conversion and near infrared in Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped phosphate glass ceramics has been investigated. Efficient green and red up-conversion luminescence and strong infrared fluorescence at 1.54Î¼m wavelength are observed under excitation of 975nm. The fluorescence intensity is changing at different temperature and the results are explained with the level transitions in Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped system. Meanwhile, the lifetime of Er3+:4I13/2 level corresponding to different operating temperature and pump power is also discussed, and the experimental results are fitted using multiphonon relaxation theory.",1
"The effects of concentration of Er3+ ions in tellurite glasses on the decay time, spectral width and weighted spectral peak are studied. A broad emission spectrum of width 121 nm peaked at wavelength of 1.5 Î¼m is obtained in 2.5 mol% Er doped glasses. The maximum decay time of 4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transition (at wavelength 1.5 Î¼m) is about 4.5 ms for 1.0 mol% Er doped glasses. Strong green and red upconversion emission at emission 550 nm (4S3/2 â 4I15/2) and 670 nm (4F9/2 â 4I15/2) are observed from Er3+-doped tellurite glasses upon continuous wave excitation at 975 nm. It is found that the upconversion efficiency goes up with the increasing concentration of the Er3+ ions.",1
"In this work, we focused on the possibility of obtaining intense and wide emission in the mid-infrared spectral range. The bismuth-germanate oxide glasses have been co-doped with erbium, holmium and ytterbium ions. Glasses have been synthesized in terms of high mid-infrared transmittance and low hydroxides content using low vacuum atmosphere (50â70â¯mBar). In order to maximize the mid-infrared luminescence, optimization of the rare earth ions content has been conducted. The highest emission intensity in the mid-IR has been observed in sample co-doped with molar concentration 0.1 Ho2O3/0.7 Er2O3/0.25 Yb2O3 under 980â¯nm laser diode excitation. Moreover, rare earth ions system enables to observe broadband mid-infrared luminescence in the range of 2.7â2.9â¯Î¼m due to the energy transfer and emission band overlap phenomena. Furthermore, wide emission band (FWHMâ¯=â¯193â¯nm) and high energy transfer efficiency (Î·â¯=â¯66.84%) from Yb3+ to Er3+ and Ho3+ ions are favorable from the perspective of further applications in mid-infrared fiber amplifiers and lasers.",1
"The oxidation behavior of the (Cu78Y22)98Al2 bulk metallic glass containing â¼55% Cu5Y particles (CYA-composite) was studied over the temperature range of 400â600Â°C in dry air. The results generally showed that the oxidation kinetics of the composite obeyed a two-stage parabolic-rate law, with its steady-state parabolic-rate constants (k p values) increased with temperature. In addition, the oxidation rates of the composite were significantly lower than those of the polycrystalline Cuâ20%Y alloy. The scales formed on the composite consisted mostly of hexagonal-Y2O3 (h-Y2O3) and minor CuO, while significant amounts of Cu2O and CuO, with minor amounts of Y2O3 were detected for the Cuâ20%Y alloy. It was found that the absence of Cu2O is responsible for the slower oxidation rates of CYA-composite.",0
"Silk is a strong natural proteinous fiber and E-glass is a very strong synthetic fiber. Compression molding method was used to fabricate B. mori silk fiber reinforced polypropylene (PP) matrix composites.

"Photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide have been exploited for various purposes, including the photocatalytic purification of air, where an immobilized catalyst is preferred over a dispersed one as it has much higher application value. In this work, we have investigated the photocatalytic degradation of toluene on titania nanoparticles immobilized on fiberglass cloth. The progress of the reaction was monitored using a self-constructed photoreactor equipped with UVA lamps. Commercially available P25 and PC500 powder catalysts were successfully immobilized on fiberglass cloth by a âsol suspensionâ procedure. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UVâvis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The highest photocatalytic degradation performance was obtained for the PC500 catalyst followed by a 1:1 mixture of P25 and PC500 and the lowest performance was observed in case of the P25 immobilized catalyst. The highest degradation rate of PC500 can be ascribed to its smallest particle size and highest surface area in comparison to others.",0
"Infrared (IR) to visible (VIS) and ultraviolet (UV) upconversion in Nd3+-doped fluorochloride glass has been observed between 4.2 and 300 K under continuous wave (cw) and pulsed IR laser excitation in resonance with the 4 F 3/2 and 4 F 5/2 levels. The emission spectra have UV bands at 359 and 383 nm and VIS bands located around 416, 452, 527, 589, and 660 nm. The green, yellow, and red emissions are attributed to transitions from the 4 G 7/2 excited state. The excitation spectra of the upconverted emissions which are similar to the one-photon absorption spectrum, together with the features appearing in the decays of these emissions, indicate that an energy transfer upconversion (ETU) process seems to be responsible for the VIS luminescence observed, though other possible mechanisms cannot be disregarded. Referring to the blue and UV bands, the most probable origin of the upconverted fluorescence seems to be the 4 D 3/2 , 4 D 5/2 , 4 D 1/2 levels. In the last, the participation of three neodymium ions is necessary in the ETU process.",1
"Fe65.5Cr4Mo4Ga4P12C5B5.5 bulk amorphous rectangular bars with a cross-section of 2Ã2mm2 and a length of 30mm were produced by copper mold casting. The as-cast bars as well as annealed samples were investigated by compression and Vickers hardness tests. The fracture strength for the as-cast samples Ï f is 2.8GPa and the fracture strain Îµ f is 1.9%. Upon annealing at 715K for 10min, i.e. at a temperature below the calorimetric glass transition, the fracture strain drops to 1.6% and no plastic deformation is observed. The Vickers hardness HV for the as-cast samples is about 885, and increases to 902 upon annealing. The fracture behavior of this Fe-based bulk glassy alloy is significantly different in comparison with the well-studied Zr-, Cu- or Ti-based good glass-formers. The fracture is not propagating along a well-defined direction and the fractured surface looks irregular. Instead of veins, the glassy alloy develops a high number of microcracks.",0

"The spectroscopic properties of 2-Î¼m emission in Ho3+-doped lanthanumâtungstenâtellurite glasses with different Ho2O3 concentrations were investigated. The strongest emission was observed in a glass sample doped with 0.5mol% Ho2O3, with a fluorescence lifetime of 3.16ms and a emission cross section of 6.97Ã10â21 cm2 at 2040nm. For this composition, no obvious changes in the emission properties and fluorescence lifetime were observed at temperatures of 295â350K. Using this 60TeO2â30WO3â9.5La2O3â0.5Ho2O3 glass as a core material, Ho3+-doped double cladding fiber with a core diameter of 14Î¼m and a numerical aperture of 0.12 was developed. A maximum laser output power of 34mW at 2040nm was achieved with a 9-cm-long Ho3+-doped tellurite glass fiber.

"Optical properties of Tm3+ are studied in a (high Ba2+, La3+)-tellurite glass in the absence and the presence of co-dopant Yb3+. The Tm3+ ion in this host exhibits strong VisâNIR absorption and intense NIR-emission at ~1.83Âµm along with a weak NIR emission at ~1.48Âµm upon excitation through its 794nm 3H6â3F4 absorption. Co-relation of the optical properties of the ion with its calculated optical parameters shows that the Tm3+ ion in this host, experiences a strong crystal field. In the case of the Yb3+-co-doped glass, when it is excited through the 978nm 2F7/2 â2F5/2 absorption transition of Yb3+, its Tm3+ ion shows strong ~1.83Âµm NIR-emission but no ~1.48Âµm emission. Under 980nm laser excitation, however, the Tm3+ ion of the co-doped glass, shows a strong 804nm and a relatively weak ~474nm upconversion emissions along with two other very weak components at ~648 and ~694nm. All these results indicate that an efficient phonon assisted energy transfer occurs from Yb3+ to Tm3+ in the case of the co-doped glass. The results are interpreted in terms of effect of high Ba2+ in the glass-structure and coupling of some phonons of its nonbridging oxygens with the electronic states of the incorporated Tm3+ and Yb3+. Strong ~1.83Âµm NIR-emission of the Tm3+-glass and its calculated high values of gain cross-section suggest that the glass is prospective for use as 1.75â1.90Âµm solid state laser medium; while the observed intense 804nm upconversion emission of the co-doped glass indicates that the material should be useful as bio-marker.",1

"The thermal stability of a low Tg phosphate glass (Tg=339Â°C), formulated in the ZnOâNa2OâP2O5 system, is investigated in this contribution by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). DSC measurement indicates a very important Tx âTg value (197Â°C) for the investigated composition compared to other low Tg phosphate glasses found in literature. XRD and 1D 31P solid state NMR were used to monitor the isothermal crystallization process occurring at 60Â°C above Tg (400Â°C). The mixture of phases formed after crystallization cannot be identified by XRD but 2D MAS-NMR experiment provides valuable information about the composition and the structure of the unknown sample.",1
"Solid state glass electrolyte, xLi2O-(1â x)(yB2O3-(1â y)P2O5) glasses were prepared with wide range of composition, i.e. x =0.35â0.5 and y =0.17â0.67. This material system is one of the parent compositions for chemically and electrochemically stable solid-state electrolyte applicable to thin film battery. Lithium ion conductivity of Li2OâB2O3âP2O5 glasses was studied in the correlation to the structural variation of glass network by using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The measured ionic conductivity of the electrolyte at room temperature increased with x and y.

It was shown that the addition of P2O5 reduces the tendency of devitrification and increases the maximum amount of Li2O added into glass former without devitrification. As Li2O and B2O3 contents increased, the conductivity of glass electrolyte increased due to the increase of three-coordinated [BO3] with a non-bridging oxygen (NBO).",1
"Bismuth containing glasses are interesting photonic materials due to their broadband emission properties in the near-infrared wavelength range. Bismuth alumino-borosilicate glasses co-doped with Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+ ions were prepared by the conventional glass melting process and their optical absorption, near-infrared emission, and lifetime characteristics were investigated. Upon pumping at 800nm with a Ti:sapphire laser, a very broad emission band covering at 900â1700nm was found to appear due to overlapping of the emissions centering at 1003, 1266, 1536, and 1643nm from the co-doped ions of Yb3+, Bi, Er3+, and Tm3+, respectively. The emission intensity and the lifetime of the emission bands were significantly influenced by the addition of Yb2O3. The pump energy absorbed by Bi was transferred to Yb3+ and Er3+ ions and the amount of the transferred energy was enhanced with the increase of Yb2O3. The energy transfer efficiency from Bi to the co-doped rare earth ions was ~4.0% at 2mol% of Yb2O3.",1
"In the present study, the effect of small substitution in Mg65Cu25Gd10 (at.%) alloy has been investigated for two purposes, i.e.: (1) for improvement of glass forming ability (GFA) and (2) for enhancement of compressive plasticity possibly. The Mg65Cu7.5Ni7.5Ag5Zn5Y5Gd5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) with diameter of 14mm is successfully fabricated by conventional copper mold casting method in air atmosphere, which is the highest GFA among those previously reported for Mg-based alloys. The significantly improved GFA of the MgâCuâNiâZnâAgâYâGd alloys can be properly represented by T rg, Î³ and É parameters. Although general Mg-based BMG show a little and no plasticity under compressive loading, the addition of element having positive enthalpy of mixing with constitutive element such as Be, Ag and Y increases the plasticity in a limited composition range.",0
"Soft X-ray appearance-potential spectroscopy (SXAPS) is a high resolution core-level technique for probing the local density of conduction-band states of solid surfaces. This technique has been exploited to investigate the distribution of 4f states of the rare earth metals. The spectra reflect the transitions of the N4,5 (4d) electrons to the unoccupied 4f states. These states split into a multiplet as a result of the exchange interaction between the 4f electrons and 4d holes. Multiplicity of this configuration depends upon the number of 4f electrons. A systematic study of the spectral features of rare earth series metals does not reveal any regular or orderly changes, unlike the spectra of 3d transition series metals. These results confirm that the spectra of rare earths are amenable to interpretation in terms of the atomic-like transitions involving exchange interaction rather than in terms of the continuous interband transitions. The experimental results are discussed in the light of the above theoretical considerations.",0
"Spectroscopic properties of 1.6 Î¼m emission from Ho3+-doped sulfide glass were evaluated for their potential use as U-band fiber-optic amplifiers. Emission from the 5I5 â 5I7 transition showed a peak wavelength of 1670 nm and a full width at half maximum of â¼65 nm with a cross-section of â¼7.1Ã10â21 cm2. Ho3+ concentration in glass should be limited to 0.08 mol% due to energy transfers between Ho3+ ions which lead to a decrease in the 5I5 level lifetime. Co-doping of Tb3+ effectively decreased terminal 5I7 level lifetimes via the energy transfer of Ho3+:5I7 âTb3+:7F0, 1, 2.",1

"Effect of the addition of a small amount of Ge on mechanical properties and fracture behavior of Cu50Zr43Al7 (at.%) bulk metallic glass were studied. The Cu50Zr43Al7 alloy has a surprising glass-forming ability (GFA), and the glassy rods up to 4mm in diameter can be formed. Partial addition of Ge causes the crystalline phases precipitate in the glassy matrix of (Cu50Zr43Al7)100âx Ge x (x =0, 1, 2) rods with a diameter of 4mm. In uniaxial compression, Cu50Zr43Al7 bulk metallic glass exhibit high strength of 1692MPa and very limited plasticity of 0.05%.

"This paper investigates the effect of fibre properties of composite structures on the mechanical performance and formation of low-velocity impact damage. Quasi-static indentation tests were conducted on a comprehensive set of scaled Quasi Isotropic (QI) S-glass/8552 epoxy and QI IM7-carbon/8552 epoxy laminates, comparing changes in both in-plane dimensions and fully three-dimensionally scaled cases. Due to the higher thickness of the S-glass laminates, the mechanical results were normalized by a thickness scaling rule to have a fair comparison between the mechanical behaviour. The results demonstrated that the shape of the load-displacement of the S-glass/epoxy laminates is similar to that of the IM7-carbon laminates, with evident changes in rigidity appearing due to the onset and propagation of delamination and final failure caused by fibre breakage. The S-glass/8552 epoxy laminates had smaller load drops, higher deflection and higher mechanical energy absorption before failure compared to the IM7-carbon/8552 epoxy laminates. X-ray computed tomography scanning revealed that delamination is the dominant failure mode for the investigated laminates, and the shape of delamination was influenced by the ply angles at the interfaces. Comparing the glass and carbon laminates, ultrasonic C-scan results indicated similar delamination damage size for the initiation stage, however the damage size was found to be dependent on the fibre properties and layup sequence in the propagation stage.",0
"The effect of a thermoplastic polyester binder on the thermophysical and mechanical properties of an S2-glass/epoxyâamine system was investigated. The purpose of the polymeric binder is to bond the individual fabric layers together during preforming prior to composite fabrication. This paper will address the significance of the binder chemistry, i.e., the compatibility of the binder with the matrix polymer, on the composite properties. The peel strength of preforms consolidated with various concentrations of binder was evaluated using the T-peel test. The highest peel resistance was obtained from preforms that have full coverage of the binder on the glass fabric. Further increase of the concentration of the binder does not change the peel strength. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on peel test fracture surfaces revealed mostly adhesive-type failure between binder and fiber. Double cantilever beam (DCB) and short beam shear (SBS) test results of the composite showed that the presence of about 2.6 wt% of the polyester binder reduces the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness and apparent interlaminar shear strength of the S2-glass/SC-15 epoxy-amine system by about 60% and 25%, respectively. Moreover, the T g of the matrix polymer within the interlaminar region decreases about 6Â°C due to the presence of the binder. The dissolution of the polyester binder within the reacting matrix resin is limited for the standard cure cycle.",0
"Magnetic field dependence of magnetization and electrical resistance of the layered compound PrSb2 has been measured under pressure. Two metamagnetic transitions at H 1(=0.4T) and H 2(â1.4T) were observed in both M(H) and R(H) curves. It is found that H 1 increases but H 2 decreases with pressure. Pressure coefficients of H 1 and H 2 are 0.67 and â0.24TGPaâ1, respectively. H 1 begins to decrease and the magnitude of dH 2/dP changes around 1GPa.",0
"Surface visualization of a negative lead-acid battery electrode during charging and discharging using atomic force microscopy was performed. To accommodate the fine resolution of AFM and its inability to follow rough surfaces of the negative active mass of a real battery electrode, a smooth lead metal electrode was used. The focus was on the role of expanders on growth and dissolution of lead sulfate crystals. In one series of experiments we studied the effect of glass fibers embedded by pressure in the lead surface. The other series of experiments involved also glass fibers, but with the surface treated by lignosulfonates. It was observed that lignosulfonates suppress formation of the passivation layer on the electrode. On the other hand they cause higher polarization resistance of the electrode and reduce charge acceptance during charging.",0
"Numerical values are presented for 14 energy interactions, or associated coupling constants, and atomic propertiesâspin-orbit coupling constant, magnetic hyperfine structure constant, etc. The calculations have been carried out, using numerical Hartree-Fock functions, for the first excited states, arising from the same 3dN 4s 0 configurations as the groundstates, and the groundstates and first excited states of the configurations 3dN 4s 2 of the negative ions, neutral atoms, and first four positive ions of the transition elements.",0
"A bulk metallic glass (BMG) with large plasticity was prepared and its fracturing behavior was observed at a strain rate larger than â¼10â3 sâ1 under uniaxial compression. Even in this strain rate condition, the BMG still exhibits an excellent plastic deformability. The BMG exhibits a large elastic limitation of about 2.43% for engineering strain and 2.46% for true strain. The engineering and true plastic strains are 3.05% and 3.18%, respectively, and the maximum compressive strength is 1810MPa. High dense shear bands appear in the outer surfaces of the failed BMG, of which the fracture surface exhibits melting and subsequently tearing-up signs with low vein height and small droplet, orientating significantly. The fracture angle is about 54Â°, deviating from the theoretical fracture angle by 9Â°. These may be related to the unique performance characteristics and the micro-structure of the BMG.",0
The as-quenched samples in the system (100â x) TeO2-(x) Ba5Li2Ti2Nb8O30 (2â©½ x â©½8) were found to be embedded with 10â20Î¼m sized crystallites of the polar phase Ba5Li2Ti2Nb8O30 (BLTN). Blue (400nm) second harmonic generation (SHG) was observed in transmission mode when 800nm laser light was allowed to pass through the individual crystallites. The blue SHG signal was temperature dependent and its intensity was maximum at â¼175Â°C which was tentatively attributed to the concomitant changes associated with the refractive indices of the BLTN crystallites. The SHG intensity attained a minimum value around the Curie temperature of BLTN crystals.,1
"The superior specific energy absorption characteristics of long fiber composite structures as compared to aluminum and steel are well established. Due to cost and time involved in testing of composites, it is imperative to develop numerical solution of the crushing phenomenon. The work presented here reports work to better understand the energy absorption characteristics of glassâfiber circular crush tubes. The effect of tube diameter and ply orientation on the energy absorption has been extensively investigated. Numerical results are compared with experiments performed elsewhere and the correlation between the two is encouraging.",0
"The influence of BaF2 on the physical and spectroscopic properties of Cr3+/Ho3+ co-doped germanate glass is investigated systematically by differential scanning calorimeter, excitation and emission spectra, as well as dynamic decay lifetime. The intense and broad absorption band of Cr3+ provides a selective pump scheme for obtaining an efficient 2.0Î¼m emission of Ho3+, the OHâ absorption coefficient, on the other hand, is decreased as low as 1.08cmâ1, which both highly conducive to obtain an intense 2.0Î¼m emission of Ho3+. In addition, the crystal-field parameter D q /B of Cr3+-doped glasses is also calculated to study the influence of BaF2 on the local environment of activators and sensitizers. Further theoretic calculation shows that the largest absorption and emission cross-sections of Ho3+ near 2.0Î¼m are as high as 4.6 and 5.2 (Ã10â21 cm2) in the 10mol% BaF2 modified Cr3+/Ho3+ co-doped glass and the maximum energy transfer efficiency from Cr3+ to Ho3+ is about 42.5%. All results suggest that this BaF2 modified Cr3+/Ho3+ co-doped glass is very suitable for a high-efficient 2.0Î¼m fiber lasers with flexible pump sources.",1
"Ni-based metallic glasses containing no metalloids are developed in NiâZrâNbâAl alloy system. A partial replacement of Zr with Nb in NiâZrâAl alloys significantly enhances the glass-forming ability (GFA) and enlarges the undercooled liquid region during continuous heating of glassy ribbons. A quaternary NiâZrâNbâAl metallic glasses exhibit large undercooled liquid region (>50 K), indicating high glass-forming ability of the alloy. The glass transition and crystallization temperatures of a quaternary Ni61Zr28Nb7Al4 alloy are 848 and 898 K, respectively, exhibiting a wide undercooled liquid region of 50 K. A complete Ni61Zr28Nb7Al4 glassy rod (Ï1 mm) can be prepared by copper mold injection casting.",0
"Phase transition in S U ( N ) symmetric models for the adjoint field Ï in the case of arbitrary N is investigated. We examine the fluctuation-induced symmetry breaking from the point of view of the ferromagnetic phase transition in the large spin Fermi system, where the order parameter ã Ï ã occurs discontinuously for N â¥ 4 . The free energies of the systems are analyzed within both Îµ-expansion and the functional renormalization group.",0
"A Zr-base bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloy with the base composition Zrâ10 at.%Alâ5% Tiâ17.9% Cuâ14.6% Ni (BAM-11) was used to study the effects of oxygen impurities and microalloying on the microstructure and mechanical properties. Oxygen impurity at a level of 3000 appm dramatically reduced the glass forming ability and embrittled BAM-11 at room temperature. The embrittlement was due to the formation of oxygen-induced Zr4Ni2O nuclei that triggered near complete crystallization of the metallic glass. Microalloying with 0.1 at.%B+0.2%Si+0.1%Pb was effective in suppressing the crystalline phase formation and alleviating the detrimental effect of oxygen. Microstructural analyses indicate that the beneficial effect of the optimum dopants was mainly due to stabilization of the glass-phase matrix even though it contained high levels of oxygen. Thus, microalloying is effective in reducing the production cost and is very useful for manufacturing good-quality Zr-based BMGs from impure charge materials.",0
"Lead fluorosilicate (SKNPfLfDy) glasses doped with various Dy3+ ion concentrations employed via melt-quenching method have been prepared and studied their thermal, optical and spectral properties for the spreading out of yellow laser applications. The emission spectra have prominent emission at 575â¯nm (4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H13/2) transition. The stimulated emission cross-section (5.14â¯Ãâ¯10â21â¯cm2) and branching ratio (62%) for the 4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H13/2 transition were found to be relatively high. Lifetime is decreased from 1192â¯Î¼s to 34â¯Î¼s with increase in concentration due to concentration quenching as well cross-relaxation among the Dy3+ ions. The quantum efficiency found to be 69%. The optical gain, figure of merit, yellow/blue (Y/B) intensity ratio and gain bandwidth for 1.0â¯mol% Dy3+:SKNPfLf glass is found to be 27.55â¯Ãâ¯10â25â¯cm2â¯s, 19.01â¯Ãâ¯10â25â¯cm2â¯s, 3.96 and 63.32â¯Ãâ¯10â28â¯cm3, respectively. The obtained results revealed that the SKNPfLfDy glasses possibly useful for yellow laser applications.",1
"P2O5âLi2OâYb2O3âSb2O3 glasses doped with Pr3+ ion had been prepared to explore white-light-emitting materials. The photoluminescence spectra of the glasses were measured under 270nm excitation. The emission color of the glass doped with 2mol% Pr3+ ion was white to the naked eye, and the CIE coordinates (0.336, 0.319) of the sample were close to the standard equal energy white-light illumination (x=0.333, y=0.333). The present working mechanism of the commercial white-LEDs is that a yellow phosphor is excited by a blue LED chip. The emission characters are restricted by the intensity of the blue light and the thickness of the phosphor. However, the luminescent characters of our materials are not effected by the pumping light. Thus, our materials will be helpful in developing white-light-emitting materials.",1
"We have investigated the electronic, dynamical, and thermodynamic properties of the rocksalt ScX (X=N, P, As, Sb) using a plane-wave pseudopotential method within the generalized gradient approximation in the frame of density functional perturbation theory. The calculated lattice constants are found to differ by less than 0.56% from the available experimental values. These materials have the indirect ÎâX band gaps and a wide and direct band gap at the X-point in band structure, which are closer to experimental results than the previous calculations. A linear-response approach is used to calculate the phonon frequencies, the phonon density of states and LOâTO splitting. The obtained phonon frequencies at the zone-center (Î-point) for the Raman-active and infrared-active modes are analyzed. We also calculate the thermodynamic functions using the phonon density of states, and the calculated values are in nearly perfect agreement with experimental data.",0
"Spectral bandwidth of spontaneous Raman scattering of tellurite glasses was significantly widened upon introduction of MoO3 or WO3. Tellurite glasses modified with MoO3 presented Raman scattering spectra with full width at half maximum of â¼300cmâ1 centered at Stokes shift of â¼800cmâ1 without much reduction of its relative Raman scattering coefficient. Such enhancements of the Raman scattering characteristics of the modified tellurite glasses, together with their good thermal stability, proposed their high potential as a wideband fiber Raman amplifier for optical communications. Broadening of the Raman scattering bandwidth is discussed in terms of structural changes accompanied.",1
"La4Ti9O24 and Bi2O3-substituted La2O3âTiO2 glasses were prepared by aerodynamic levitation technique. The effect of Bi2O3 substitution on the thermal stability, refractive index and transmittance spectrum of the as-prepared samples were investigated. After Bi2O3 substitution, the stability of La2O3âTiO2âBi2O3 glass decreased, but the Abbe number increased with glass refractive indices above 2.2 in visible region. The high refractive index can be attributed to the large oxygen packing densities and electronic polarizabilities of oxygen ions in the glasses.",1
"In this article, Sm2O3 doped Lithium Alumino-borate (LABS) glasses were prepared by melt-quench technique. Physical, structural, thermal and spectroscopic properties are investigated by various techniques. The emission spectra consist of three sharp peaks at 562.5, 599, 645.5â¯nm within the 4f electronic configuration of Sm3+ ions and two feeble emission peaks at 691, 711â¯nm of Sm2+ ion at 402â¯nm excitation. Among all prepared glass samples, glass doped with 0.5â¯mol% Sm2O3 (LABS-4) shows highest emission intensity with CIE chromaticity coordinates xâ¯=â¯0.55 and yâ¯=â¯0.44 in the orange zone of the chromaticity diagram. The CIE plot and the images of glass samples show; the glass doped with 0.5â¯mol% Sm2O3 emit intense orange light at 402â¯nm excitation and can be useful for intense orange LED application.",1
"The aim of this paper is to assess the performance of self-compacting glass concrete (SCGC) after exposure to four elevated temperatures of 300Â°C, 500Â°C, 600Â°C and 800Â°C. The influence of curing conditions on the high temperature performance of SCGC was also investigated. For each curing regime, five SCGC mixtures were prepared with recycled glass (RG) which was used to replace natural fine aggregate at the level of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. After exposure to the elevated temperatures, concrete mass loss, density, water porosity, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and water sorptivity were determined and then a compressive strength test was conducted. The test results indicate that regardless of the exposure temperature, all the water cured specimens had higher residual strengths and mass losses while the water porosity and water sorptivity values were lower as compared to the corresponding air cured specimens. The incorporation of RG in the concrete mixes helped to maintain the concrete properties after the high temperature exposure due to the melting and resolidification of the recycled glass in the concrete matrix.",0
"The (100â x)Na3BO3Â·xNa2SO4 (0â¤ x (mol%)â¤50) glasses were prepared by mechanical milling. Halo patterns were observed in the compositions 0â¤ x â¤50 by XRD measurements. The Raman spectra indicated that all the glasses were composed of BO3 3â anions, SO4 2â anions and Na+ cations. The (100â x)Na3BO3Â·xNa2SO4 glasses showed good deformation properties and a dense pellet was prepared by cold-press. The conductivities of the glasses increased with increasing Na2SO4 content, and the 50Na3BO3Â·50Na2SO4 glass showed the highest conductivity of 5.9Ã10â8 Scmâ1 at 25Â°C.",1
"The microstructure of bulk samples of the copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors commonly is describable in terms of anisotropic grains of stoichiometric material separated by layers of nonstoichiometric interface material. The granularity strongly influences the electromagnetic properties, especially the transport critical-current density and the magnetization. In this paper, a simple theoretical model for the granularity is introduced and then used to discuss a number of electrodynamic properties (hysteretic magnetization versus magnetic field, zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization versus temperature, ac susceptibility, and flux creep with logarithmic time dependence). Special attention is drawn to the importance of distinguishing between intragranular and intergranular effects.",0
MÃ¶ssbauer spectra of amorphous Fe4Ni74Si9 B13 indicate a spin-glass freezing temperature T f = (11.o Â± o.5)K. For T < Tf the measured average hyperfine field Hint as a function of temperature T follows the relation H int = H sat . (1âT/Tf)Î² with Î² = o.4o Â± o.o5 and a saturation hyperfine field H sat = 26o kOe. For T > Tf quadrupole-split spectra were observed (ÎE O = o.45 mm/s); it was found by application of magnetic fields that rapidly relaxing superparamagnetic clusters exist far above Tf. The average cluster moment was estimated to be roughly 7o Î¼B.,0
"Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is one of the wood composites which are used widely in the furniture industry. Therefore, its strengthening is required. Sandwiched material is manufactured by inserting sugarcane bagasse medium density fiberboard between the glass fiber reinforced laminates in just the same fashion as a sandwich. A hand lay-up technique is used to prepare the sandwiched specimen, in which the medium density fiberboard plate is put in between two woven layers of glass fiber epoxy laminates. Tensile and bending tests are done to investigate efficiently the tensile and flexural behaviors for the MDF strengthening process. In addition, compact tension and center notch specimen tests are carried out to obtain the effect of the modification performed for the MDF main material on fracture toughness. Moreover, a water soaking test is held out, and fungal bioassay resistance is investigated to obtain some of the novel material environments. The results illustrate that both tensile and flexural strength are extremely modified and increased. Besides, the results show compatibility and bonding between layered material and medium density fiberboard plate. The fracture toughness is greatly increased, and both tests can be met as regards fracture toughness tests for such novel composite material. The novel material has high resistance to fungal creation, which helps it to be utilized in medical furniture. Finally, it is found that only a very little percentage of absorption is established for the novel produced material.",0
"Objectives To evaluate the efficiency of immediate dentin sealing and the effects of different bonding protocols on the fracture strength of CAD/CAM occlusal veneers bonded to exposed dentin. Methods Ninety-six extracted maxillary premolars were initially divided into three main groups with 32 specimens each: without immediate dentin sealing, immediate dentin sealing/total etching and immediate dentin sealing/selective etching. Teeth were identically prepared in the dentin to receive occlusal veneers of 0.8mm thickness, milled from lithium disilicate ceramic blocks (IPS e.max CAD). Each main group was later subdivided, according to the pre-cementation surface etching protocol (total/selective), into two subgroups with 16 specimens each. All restorations were adhesively bonded using a resin cement (Variolink Esthetic). Half of the specimens of each subgroup were subjected to thermo-dynamic loading in a chewing simulator with 1,200,000 cycles at 10kg load. The other half and the surviving specimens were subjected to quasi-static loading until failure. Statistical analysis was performed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests. Results All specimens except one survived the artificial aging. A significantly higher fracture strength of restorations (p â¤ 0.001) was obtained when immediate dentin sealing was followed regardless of the etching method with values ranging from a minimum of 1122 Â± 336N to a maximum of 1853 Â± 333N. Neither the pre-cementation treatment nor the artificial aging had a statistical significant effect on the fracture strength. Significance Immediate dentin sealing protocol is recommended whenever dentin is exposed during the preparation for thin glass-ceramic occlusal veneers.",0
"The thermodynamic properties of a ZBLAN system were measured in the range between glass transition temperature and melting temperature. From the values of the heat of crystallization and solidification at different temperatures, obtained at various heating and cooling rates, the specific heat of the undercooled liquid was determined. It exceeds that of the crystal phases of 0.385 J gâ1 Kâ1 in the temperature range 595 K â¤ T â¤ 673 K. The free energy difference between liquid and crystal phases has been obtained in the undercooled regime.

"Aerodynamic levitation method was employed to prepare Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+-doped titanate-based glasses. DTA results show that the glass performs high thermal stability with the glass transition temperature of 799Â Â°C. The interaction among rare earth ions has been discussed by adjusting the relative concentration. Er3+ ions can quench the upconversion luminescence of Tm3+ ions. Tm3+ ions play a strong role in quenching the emissions of Er3+ and Tm3+ when the content of Tm3+ ions is greater than or equal 0.05. From the view of the ratio of red emission to green emission, Tm3+ ions can improve the red emission of Er3+ ions to some extent in contrast with the green emissions of Er3+ ions. 980Â nm incident laser can be efficiently absorbed by Yb3+ ions. The relative intensity of red, green, and blue upconversion luminescence has been tuned to obtain white light. The composition with white upconversion luminescence of the color coordinate (0.291, 0.3292) has been found. Moreover, white upconversion luminescence mechanism is a two-photon process of ET, ESA, and cooperative sensitization. Rare earth ions doped titanate-based glasses with bright upconversion luminescence perform potential applications in color display, back light, etÂ al.",1
"Electronâelectron interaction effect of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in Al x Ga1âx N/GaN heterostructures has been investigated by means of magnetotransport measurements at low temperatures. From the temperature dependence of the longitudinal conductivity of the heterostructures, a clear transition region has been observed. Based on the theoretical analysis, we conclude that this region corresponds to the transition from the diffusive regime to the ballistic regime of the 2DEG transport property. The interaction constant is determined to be â0.423, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction. However, the critical temperature for the transition, which is 8 K in Al x Ga1âx N/GaN heterostructures, is much higher than the theoretical prediction.",0

"Spectroscopic properties of Er3+:4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transitions in erbium-doped bismuth-borate glasses with composition of 45Bi2O3â35B2O3â10GeO2â10Na2O were investigated. The results show that the fluorescence intensity reveals a nonexponential decaying behavior for glasses with low Er3+-doped concentration. It is ascribed to the energy transfer from Er3+ to OHâ groups, and the energy-transfer microparameter C ErâOH is about 33.1Ã10â40 cm6 sâ1 in Er2O3-doped content of 0.1mol% glass. Whereas an exponential behavior is dominant for glasses with high Er3+-doped case. Nonradiative decay in the latter is mainly originated from the energy migration among Er3+ ions, and this energy migration is also responsible for the concentration quenching of 1.53Î¼m fluorescence emission. The interaction microparameter C ErâEr for the migration among Er3+ ions was calculated to be an average of 43.9Ã10â40 cm6 sâ1. Meanwhile, the radiation trapping of Er3+ leads to the effective emission width broadening from 66.3 to 82.5nm with Er2O3 doped content increased from 0.1 to 3.0mol%.",1
"Objectives This study was designed to evaluate the effect of an increase of fiber-density on some mechanical properties of higher volume fiber-reinforced composite (FRC). Methods Five groups of FRC with increased fiber-density were fabricated and two additional groups were prepared by adding silanated barium-silicate glass fillers (0.7Î¼m) to the FRC. The unidirectional E-glass fiber rovings were impregnated with light-polymerizable bisGMA-TEGDMA (50â50%) resin. The fibers were pulled through a cylindrical mold with an opening diameter of 4.2mm, light cured for 40s and post-cured at elevated temperature. The cylindrical specimens (n =12) were conditioned at room temperature for 2 days before testing with the three-point bending test (Lloyd Instruments Ltd.) adapted to ISO 10477. Fiber-density was analyzed by combustion and gravimetric analyzes. Results ANOVA analysis revealed that by increasing the vol.% fraction of E-glass fibers from 51.7% to 61.7% there was a change of 27% (p <0.05) in the modulus of elasticity, 34% (p <0.05) in the toughness, and 15% (p <0.05) in the load bearing capacity, while there was only 8% (p <0.05) increase in the flexural strength although it was statistically insignificant. The addition of particulate fillers did not improve the mechanical properties. Significance This study showed that the properties of FRC could be improved by increasing fibervolume fraction. Modulus of elasticity, toughness, and load bearing capacity seem to follow the law of ratio of quantity of fibers and volume of the polymer matrix more precisely than flexural strength when high fiber-density is used.",0
"As the properties of wireâ¯+â¯arc additively manufactured Al-6.3Cu alloy cannot meet the applying requirements, a double-wireâ¯+â¯arc additive manufacturing system was built to add magnesium into Al-Cu deposits for higher mechanical properties. Two commercial binary wires aluminum-copper ER2319 and aluminum-magnesium ER5087 were chosen as the filler metal to build Al-Cu-Mg components with different compositions by adjusting the wire feed speed. The microstructure and morphology of thin wall samples were characterized by optical micrographs (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Vickers hardness and tensile properties were investigated. The microstructure of Al-Cu-Mg deposits was mainly composed of coarse columnar grains and fine equiaxed grains with non-uniformly distributing characteristics. With higher Cu but lower Mg content, the strengthen phase turned to Al2Cuâ¯+â¯Al2CuMg from Al2CuMg, and the micro hardness presented an increasing trend. The isotropic characteristics of ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and elongation were revealed in these samples. The UTS was about 280â¯Â±â¯5â¯MPa both in horizontal and vertical directions for all samples. The YS showed an increasing trend from 156â¯MPa to 187â¯MPa with the same content trend, while elongation decreased from 8.2% to 6%. The fractographs exhibited typical brittle fracture characteristics.",0
"MoâSi alloy sheets with different silicon content were fabricated by powder-metallurgical and thermo-mechanically processing. The effect of Si content and annealing temperature on microstructure and hardness of the MoâSi alloys were studied by using optical microscopy (OM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Vickers hardness tester, respectively. The results indicated that the presence of Si can effectively refine the grain sizes and improve the hardness of MoâSi alloys. Si can also increase the recrystallization temperature of alloys and play a significant role in restraining the grain growth at high temperatures. Increasing the annealing temperature, the microstructure of MoâSi alloy sheets is gradually coarsened and changed from fibrous to equiaxed structure, causing reduction in hardness. The hardening effect in the MoâSi alloys came from the refined grain strengthening, solid solution strengthening, and second phase particle strengthening, which are closely dependent on the Si content and annealing temperature.",0
The magnetization of a dilute Ag-Mn alloy (150 ppm) was studied from 4 K down to 10 mK in magnetic fields ranging from 932 to 1 Oe. The non-linear susceptibility is analyzed in terms of a scaling theory. Scaling exponents agree with those in much higher concentration spin glasses.,0
"Samples of (Cu46Zr46Al8)100âx Z x metallic glass forming alloys with diameters 2â6mm were prepared by injection casting. The effect of minor amounts of elements Z=Gd, Co and Re with positive enthalpy of mixing within the GdâZr, CuâCo and CuâRe terminal systems was compared. The addition of Gd up to x =2 slightly enhances the glass forming ability, Co reduces the critical diameter of bulk metallic glass formation, whereas even for small fractions of Re bulk samples were crystalline, but only amorphous splats can be prepared. Both Gd and Co diminish the crystallization temperature T x with respect to the Cu46Zr46Al8 master alloy, but in Re-bearing splats T x is increased. Alloying with optimum amounts of Gd and Co up to x =2 leads to plastic deformability of rods, 2 and 3mm in diameter, in comparison with the brittle Cu46Zr46Al8 bulk metallic glass.",0
"The as-cast Mg-4Zn-2Gd-0.5Ca alloy mainly contained I phase and W phase, while the I phase dissolved into Mg substrate after homogenization treatment which improved the alloyâs corrosion resistance. After the application of multidirectional forging (MDF), the grains were refined obviously accompanied with the precipitation of I phase. With the increasing pass of MDF, both the size of dynamic recrystallized grains and the amount of precipitated I phase increased. The corrosion resistance of Mg-4Zn-2Gd-0.5Ca alloy became worse after 1 pass of MDF as compared with the as-homogenizated condition because of the precipitation of I phase. Neverthless, the corrosion resistance of the as-MDFed Mg-4Zn-2Gd-0.5Ca alloy deteriorated with the increasing pass of MDF. As compared with grain refinement, the precipitated I phase is thought to play a main role on the corrosion behavior of Mg-4Zn-0.5Ca alloy.",0
"Oxyfluoro tellurite glasses with chemical composition TeO2-ZnO-YF3-NaF (TZYN), doped with Nd3+ in different concentrations were prepared by the melt-quenching technique. JuddâOfelt analyses of Nd3+ ions in the precursor glasses were performed to evaluate the phenomenological intensity parameters Î©2,4,6. From the NIR emission spectra, characteristic parameters such as effective band with (âÎ»eff) and stimulated emission cross section (ÏP) were calculated for the three observed transitions, 4F3/2 â 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 and compared to other reported glasses. Based on the luminescence decay times of 4F3/2 excited state, the quantum efficiency was evaluated and it is highest for a 0.2â¯mol% Nd3+ doped glass (G-Nd2). Glass ceramics were obtained by controlled heat treatment of the glasses at 390â¯Â°C for 5â¯h (as determined by DSC), which is greater than the glass transition temperature Tg. Moreover, DSC results revealed that precipitation of the NdYF4 nanocrystalline phase (TC1) decreased with increasing Nd3+ concentration. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) investigations reveal that spherical NaYF4 nano-crystals are distributed homogeneously across the glassy matrix. The emission intensity of the 4F3/2â4I11/2 transition at 1.60â¯Âµm was enhanced in glass ceramics as compared to glasses because of the occupancy of the Nd3+ in NaYF4 nanocrystlline phase. The experimental lifetime value of 4F3/2 also enhanced from 124 to 187 Âµs from G-Nd2 glass to GC-Nd2 glass ceramic and decreased with increasing Nd3+ concentration.",1
"The optimization of the photocatalytic activity and hydrophilic conversion of TiO2 is an active research area in the field of self-cleaning materials and energy storage/conversion. One major focus is the crystalline phase of TiO2, known to be the most efficient of the anatase structures. Another issue is the decoration of TiO2 with noble metals, which act as charge carrier traps for electrons. The latter hinders or reduces the electronâhole recombination rate and often leads to a more efficient photocatalytic activity. In this paper, we describe how an interlayer consisting of 3â4nm silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) promotes TiO2 anatase crystallisation and has a positive effect on the photoinduced catalytic and hydrophylic properties of TiO2 thin films. Ag-NPs and TiO2 were deposited by magnetron sputtering in the same reactor in a two-step process: a) condensation of Ag-NPs produced in the gas phase thanks to a high-pressure discharge, and b) conventional TiO2 magnetron deposition in oxide mode. Four temperatures from RT to 288Â°C were investigated and film thickness was 80nm. Particle size and film structure were determined by TEM, HRTEM and XRD. Photocatalytic activities of the samples were tracked by the evaluation of the surface hydrophilicity after UV illumination and 24hours post-illumination, and by UV-induced palmitic acid degradation.",0
"The paper reports dielectric measurements carried out for a variety of threshold and memory alloys of glassy Asî¸Geî¸Te and Seî¸Geî¸Te at different temperatures (83 to 373 K) and various frequencies (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.6 and 5.0 MHz). It is found that the glassy system of chalcogenides exists in the form of molecular dipoles which remain frozen at low temperatures and, as the temperature is increased, the molecules attain freedom of rotation at temperatures which are sometimes as low as 253 K. All the materials displayed dielectric dispersion in the radio frequency range. Gevers' formula has been used to calculate the dielectric loss (Ïµâ²') and loss-angle (tan Î´) from the measured values of the real part of dielectric constant (Ïµâ²). The curves: log Ïµâ² versus temperature, Ïµâ² versus log Ï, Ïµâ³ versus log Ï, tan Î´ versus log Ï and tan Î´ versus temperature, gave a direct evidence of the existence of a Debye-type relaxation having a wide distribution of relaxation times. Cole-Cole diagrams have been used to determine the distribution parameter (Î±) and the molecular relaxation time (Ï). The temperature dependence of Î± and Ï for all the alloys is consistent with the âmolecular relaxation mechanismâ. The paper also reports accurate values of the static and optical dielectric constants for all the alloys. Eyring's relaxation rate equations have been used to determine the free energy of activation (ÎF), and enthalpy of activation (ÎH) for all the alloys. These results indicate the existence of a stronger intermolecular interaction for Seî¸Geî¸Te alloys. mott's concept of âdangling bondsâ has also been used to explain the existence of a stronger intermolecular interaction, and hence a greater density of defect states in case of Seî¸Geî¸Te as compared with Asî¸Geî¸Te alloys. It has been finally concluded that the dielectric behaviour of chalcogenide glasses, in general, can be successfully explained by using the theory of molecular relaxation.",1
"The in-plane resistivity of an oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7âÎ´ single crystal has been measured as a function of magnetic field B||c-axis in the range 0 Tâ©½Bâ©½12 T . A scaling relation is found for the linear resistivity at Ïâ²0.1Ï n above the glass line that incorporates all studied temperatures and magnetic fields. Our scaling can be understood within a simple model where the mean pinning energy balances the thermal energy at the glass transition, U 0(B,T g)=k B T g, with U 0(B,T) resembling a generalized condensation energy, U 0â¼(1âT/T c) m /B Î² .",0
"Criteria for evaluating the glass forming ability (GFA) of LaâAlâ(Cu,Ni) alloys were studied. The GFA criteria can be categorized into two types, according to whether the liquidus temperature T l is included in the formula or not. The T l inclusive criteria generally predict a maximum in GFA at the eutectic composition at which T l is a minimum. However, for LaâAlâ(Cu,Ni) alloys, the best GFA does not correspond to the eutectic. The paper discusses the suggestion that the solidification temperature T s should be used instead of T l for evaluating the GFA of LaâAlâ(Cu,Ni) alloys.",0
"Al2O3 coatings with different thicknesses (160, 320, 480 and 640Î¼m) were deposited on stainless steel substrate by plasma spraying. The variation in microstructural characteristics and properties of coatings with various thicknesses was investigated. Powders morphology and the microstructure of as-sprayed coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The microhardness was measured using a Vickers' indentor. The corrosion behaviour of plasma-sprayed Al2O3 coatings in 1N H2SO4 solution at a temperature of 25Â°C was evaluated by electrochemistry method. Experimental results indicated that surface roughness showed no obvious dependence on the coating thickness. However, the porosity of Al2O3 coating was increased with increased thickness. The enhanced coating thickness also resulted in decreasing microhardness and reduced corrosion resistance. In this study, the Al2O3 coating with thickness of 160Î¼m possesses the lowest porosity, the highest hardness and superior corrosion resistance.",0
"Pr3+âYb3+âcodoped fluoride glass waveguides have been synthesized by Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD). A study of the evaporation of ternary mixture of rare earth fluorides LaF3âPrF3âYbF3 has been necessary to control the doping of the evaporated glass. Optical and spectroscopic studies have been performed in both bulk and waveguide configuration. Red, orange, green and blue emissions in Pr3+âYb3+-codoped lanthanum flurozirconate glasses called ZLAG have been investigated, by exciting in the blue or in the infra-red at 980nm. Bulk samples with different dopant concentrations (0.25â3mol% for Pr3+ and 0â5mol% for Yb3+) have been studied in order to optimize the Pr3+ emission. It has been shown than the luminescence is similar in bulk and waveguide upon excitation at 980nm.",1
"Glass-fibre reinforced cement composites have been made using new types of cement matrices and subjected to hot water immersion ageing regimes. The matrices were characterised by pore solution expression and analysis, XRD and DTA/TGA. Composite specimens were subjected to direct tensile tests. The new matrices displayed substantially reduced pore solution alkalinity and calcium hydroxide precipitation when compared with ordinary Portland cement (OPC), thus providing a less aggressive environment for the fibres. Mechanical tests showed that the rate of degradation of composites made from the new matrices, when aged at 65Â°C in water, was an order of magnitude lower than that for OPC matrix composites. The validity of this type of accelerated test is discussed.",0
"Previous research has shown that methyl methacrylates can be reinforced with various types of fibers and fillers. Glass-fiber reinforcement has been somewhat successful; however, surface treatment techniques are difficult to perform in the dental office. This study suggests that glass fibers can be pretreated with a silane coupling agent to obtain a chemical bond between the fibers and the acrylic resin. Transverse strength of one methyl methacrylate was tested after it was filled with either untreated or silane-treated glass fibers. Samples with untreated fibers tested weaker than samples without fibers. Samples with silane-treated fibers tested stronger, but the differences in strength were not statistically significant. The variances among samples with treated fibers were high. The procedures described in this study show promise of potentially practical techniques for strengthening provisional fixed partial dentures.",0
"This study investigates the influence of maleicanhydride-modified polypropylene (m-PP) on monotonic mechanical properties of continuous-glass-fibre-reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites. Maleicanhydride-modified polypropylene was added to the PP homopolymer to improve the adhesion between the matrix and the glass fibre. Three-point bending tests were performed on 0Â° and 90Â° unidirectional glass-fibre/PP laminates with various weight fractions of m-PP in the PP matrix. These tests showed an increase in both longitudinal and transverse flexural strength up to 10 wt% m-PP, whereas at higher weight fractions of m-PP a decrease in flexural strength was observed. No significant influence of m-PP on composite stiffness was observed. Additional mechanical tests on unidirectional glass/PP composites with 0 wt% and 10 wt% m-PP showed only a small increase in fibre-dominated properties such as longitudinal tensile strength and strain, whereas composite properties that are governed by the interphase, such as transverse, shear and compressive strength, showed significant increases as a result of matrix modification and an enhanced interaction between the glass fibres and the PP matrix.",0
"The design of concrete members reinforced with fiber-reinforced-polymer (FRP) bars is typically governed by serviceability state rather than ultimate state. This necessitates verifying the crack width in FRP-reinforced concrete (FRP-RC) members at service load. Recent developments in the FRP industry led to the introduction of FRP bars with different surface configurations and mechanical properties, which are expected to affect their bond performance. In the absence of test data, the design codes and guides, however, recommend bond-dependent coefficient (kb ) values considering the surface configurations. Thus, this study aims at investigating the kb values and verifying the dependency of the kb values on FRP bar type (glass [GFRP] and carbon [CFRP]), diameter, and concrete type, and strength limited to the first critical flexural-crack width. The investigation included 16 beams measuring 4250mm longÃ200mm wideÃ400mm deep. The beams were reinforced with sand-coated GFRP bars, helically-grooved GFRP bars, and sand-coated CFRP bars and were fabricated with normal- and high-strength concretes (NSC and HSC). The measured first critical-crack widths and measured strains were used to assess the current kb values recommended in FRP design codes and guides. The findings did not support using the same kb value for FRP bars of different types (carbon and glass) with similar surface configurations.",0
"The primary concern for glass fiber reinforced cement composites (GFRC) is the durability of glass fibers in the alkaline environment of cement. Despite the use of improved alkaline-resistant glass fibers (AR-glass) and pozzolanic materials such as silica fume and fly ash, durability concerns still exist. This report presents an experimental investigation on the hot-water durability of glass fiber reinforced cement composites. Hot-water durabilities of AR-glass fiber reinforced composites in blended cement matrix were compared for their flexural and tensile performance. The different matrices selected were (a) cement; (b) cement + 25% metakaolin; and (c) cement + 25% silica fume. Specimens after normal curing of 28 days were immersed in a hot water bath at 50Â°C for up to 84 days and then tested in flexure and tension. The results indicate that the blended cement consisting of synthetic pozzolan metakaolin significantly improves the durability of GFRC composite.",0
"In this study, the equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) process was used to develop a novel Al matrix composite through consolidation of pure aluminum powder having different volume fractions of Al65Cu20Ti15 metallic glass (AMG) as reinforcing particles. The structural evolution and mechanical properties of the composites were investigated. The densities of the samples were measured to evaluate the performance of the consolidation process. Structural analyses showed finely distributed reinforcing particles produced through shearing deformation, imposed during ECAP. Also, amorphous structure of reinforcement remained unchanged during ECAP at all volume fractions. The relative density of Al/10 vol% AMG composites was 97.94% which is the strong evidence for capability of ECAP to produce AMG reinforced Al matrix composites. The compressive yield strength of 184Â MPa was obtained in Al/10 vol% AMG composite which showed a remarkable increase in the strength compared with pure Al. Also, the compressive yield strength of the developed composites has been compared with those estimated through the rule of mixtures.",0
"The effects of the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) temperature on the properties of BaWO4:Eu3+ phosphor thin films grown on glass substrates by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering were investigated. The deposited phosphor thin films were annealed at several RTA temperatures for 30min. The experimental results show that the crystalline phase, surface morphology, transmittance, optical band gap, and photoluminescence intensity depended strongly on the RTA temperature. A preferential orientation along (112) plane and grains with an average size of 40nm were observed for a thin film annealed at 400Â°C. As the annealing temperature increased, the average transmittance in the wavelength range of 400â1100nm gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 90.8% at 550Â°C, where the highest optical band gap of 3.98eV was obtained. The dominant emission spectra of the BaWO4:Eu3+ phosphor thin films under excitation at 323nm, regardless of the RTA temperature, exhibited an emission band at 622nm arising from the 5D0 â 7F2 transition of Eu3+ ions, indicating that the Eu3+ ions in the BaWO4 host lattice were located at sites without inversion symmetry. The results suggest that the optimum annealing temperature for fabricating highly luminescent red-emitting phosphor thin films is 500Â°C.",0
"Heat treatment of sodium silicate water glass of the nominal composition Na2O/SiO2 =1:3 was carried out from 100Â°C up to 800Â°C and the advancement of the resulting phases was followed up by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetry along with differential thermal analysis. The water glass, initially being an amorphous solid, starts to form crystals of Î²-Na2Si2O5 at about 400Â°C and crystallizes the SiO2 modification cristobalite at about 600Â°C that coexists along with Î²-Na2Si2O5 up to 700Â°C. At 750Â°C Na6Si8O19 appears as a separate phase and beyond 800Â°C, the system turns into a liquid.",1
"Glass fibers possess the ability of transmitting light through the core of the fiber. However, most of the current manufacturing techniques are time- and cost-inefficient, limiting the implementation of translucent cementitious materials. The use of fibers increases the ductility of the cementitious matrix and limits the crack widths upon loading. This is advantageous in terms of autogenous healing. This healing can be further promoted by the use of superabsorbent polymers. The combination of translucency using glass fibers with promoted self-healing properties using superabsorbent polymers was therefore assessed using a direct-mixing technique. The mixture composition was optimized, the translucent property was available, multiple cracking was achieved, cracks were able to visually close and the mechanical properties were regained. This opens up opportunities for further application of translucent materials, showing self-healing properties.",0
The zero field muon spin depolarization measurements on Cu Mn single crystals (c < 1 at% Mn) show that the spin glass freezing process above T f is inhomogeneous in space. The measured depolarization functions indicate the coexistence of regions of fast Mn-spin fluctuations (correlation times âª¡ 10â9 s) with regions of spin glass order (distribution of correlation times between 10â9 and 10â6 s).,0
"Hybrid fiber-reinforced thermoset plastic matrix composites are increasingly being used in automotive applications, owing to their high specific strength and modulus. In this study, hybrid composites were manufactured by means of hybrid reinforcement; that is, biaxial glass and woven flax fabrics in vinyl ester resin with various stackings were created via the vacuum assisted resin transferee molding (VARTM) process. The manufactured composites were tested for their mechanical properties (tensile strength, modulus, flexural strength, and impact strength) and verified by means of morphological analysis. The results demonstrated rather unexpected phenomena, such as the tensile strength of the pure woven glass fibers (85.16â¯MPa) being lower than that of the hybrid composites (143.21â¯MPa). The flexural tests indicated that the strength (305.46â¯MPa) is higher for composites with glass ply at the bottom surface, and composites with glass ply on both ends exhibit high impact strength (0.145â¯J/mm2) compared to others. A water absorption test and thermo-gravimetric analysis were also performed.",0
"The ac and dc electrical properties of the P2O5î¸BaOî¸CuO glass system have been measured. TSPC and TSDC experiments and dc conductivity as a function of time indicate the predominantly electronic character of these glasses. The conduction process can be basically explained by a polaron hopping model in an adiabatic regime. Conductivity values which depend on the glass microstructure and switching phenomena are observed. The filamentary-feature of this process suggests a Poole-Frenkel mechanism. A Debye dielectric relaxation non-simple process is deduced from the frequency and temperature dependence of loss tangent and dielectric constant. The activation energies agree with those determinated from dc measurements, suggesting a unique electronic hopping conduction mechanism in both regimes. The ac and dc electrical properties are strongly affected by the glass composition and essentially by the redox Cu+/Cut ratio. A conduction model accounting for ac and dc behaviour is finally proposed.",1
The effect of disorder on the superconducting transition temperature is studied. The tight-binding description of the electron-ion interactions is used to describe disordered strong coupling superconductors. Numerical calculation of Tc vs resistivity Ï± in three dimensional high-temperature superconductors compare quite well with experimental data.,0
"ZnSe and ZnS nanocrystals (NCs) were precipitated in glasses through heat-treatment. High resolution transmission electron microscope image confirmed that ZnSe NCs were formed in the silicate glasses, and the X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed that ZnS NCs were precipitated in the borosilicate glasses. Absorption shoulders of the ZnSe NCs and ZnS NCs appeared at ~2.76eV and ~3.78eV, corresponding to the bandgap energies of bulk ZnSe and ZnS crystals, respectively. Instead of the intrinsic emissions, broad-band visible photoluminescence from the surface defects or color centers in the glasses was observed from these ZnSe or ZnS NCs.",0
"The influence of the solvent evaporation rate on the crystallization of the poly(vinylcyclohexane)-b-poly(ethylene)-b-poly(vinylcyclohexane) (PVCHâPEâPVCH) triblock copolymer with the high T g of PVCH segment in chloroform was investigated. The competition between the crystallization of PE block and the vitrification of PVCH in the triblock copolymer was controlled through changing the solvent evaporation rate in the solution system at different temperatures (T e). It was found that the melting temperature (T m) of PVCHâPEâPVCH samples increased with increasing the T e when the T e was lower than the solvent boiling point (bp), depending on the crystalline temperatures. However, when T e was just a little above the solvent bp, two melting peaks, which corresponding to the fusion of the confined and unconfined crystals, respectively, were observed on the DSC curves of the samples. As T e increased to be higher temperature, only one lower melting peak, which corresponding to the fusion of the confined crystals, existed for each samples. It was also found that the crystallinity (X c) of the samples decreased gradually when T e was lower than the solvent bp, and then decreased suddenly when T e was just a little above the solvent bp, finally reached a plateau (about 13.5%) at higher T e. The changes in X c of the samples depend on the evaporating time in the solution. The results should be related to the competition between the crystallization of PE block in solvent and the vitrification of PVCH block with the solvent evaporation. Furthermore, the competition was controlled through changing the solvent evaporation rate. The confined and unconfined crystallization of the samples could be freely adjusted.",0
"The dynamic crossover of the sub-Rouse modes (a transition from one VogelâFulcherâTamman law to another in relaxation map) above glass transition in poly(n-alkyl methacrylates) (PnAMA) was observed and compared for the first time. The Î± and Î±â² relaxations become better resolved from each other with increasing side chain length, while the crossover relaxation time is 10â0.5Â±0.5 s, essentially independent of side chain length of the PnAMA, indicating the universal presence of the sub-Rouse modes in PnAMA. Analysis of the mechanical spectra shows that the crossover originates from change of intermolecular coupling of the sub-Rouse modes when temperature crosses T B.",0
"Eu3+-doped SnO2âSiO2 glasses were prepared using a solâgel method, where nanosized SnO2 crystals of â¼8nm in diameter were precipitated to dope the Eu3+ ions. When excited at the energy corresponding to the absorption edge of the SnO2 nanocrystals, the SnO2-doped glass exhibits fluorescence intensities of the Eu3+ ions higher than 150 times that of the glass without nanocrystals. The energies, which are absorbed by the quantum-dot effect in the nanosized crystals, are efficiently transferred into the Eu3+ ions to cause the high emission.",1
"Examination by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of the non-conducting substrate poly(methyl methacrylate) and the polypyrrole free-standing film formed at its surface in a thin-layer cell has led to an understanding of how such films may be formed. A mechanism is proposed for the origin of the wrinkle morphology observed in thin-layer cells under certain conditions, and attention is drawn to its similarity to the morphology of polypyrrole films formed on indiumâtin oxide glass electrodes. In both cases it is proposed that the porous surface of the substrate on which the film grows acts as a template for nucleation sites.",1
"The Laves phase TiCr2 is readily amorphized by 1 MeV krypton irradiation at temperatures below about 250 K. However, with continuing irradiation the glassy phase (a-TiCr2) gradually transforms to a metastable bcc structure without measurable change of local composition. The results of direct observations of migrating a-TiCr2/bcc interfaces at temperatures in the range 80â180 K yield an effective activation energy of 0.027 eV for the interface velocity. A model for this irradiation-induced phase transformation is discussed in terms of dynamic reconstruction within displacement cascades. The phenomenon has been termed âcascade-driven migration of structural interfacesâ.",0
"We examined the magnetic properties of pure PrAu2Si2 and present results of linear and nonlinear magnetic susceptibility measurements. The data show the characteristic features of a canonical spin glass, e.g. the critical behavior of the nonlinear susceptibility at the glass transition and the frequency dependence of the complex linear susceptibility near the freezing temperature, which is determined near T F â3 K. It is the first time that spin glass behavior was found in a pure rare-earth compound with well-localized magnetic moments.",0
"The mechanical properties of Cu47Ti34Zr11Ni8, Cu47Ti33Zr11Ni8Fe1, and Cu47Ti33Zr11Ni8Si1 bulk metallic glasses prepared by copper mold casting are investigated. Room temperature compression tests reveal fracture strengths above 2000 MPa, Youngâs moduli around 100 GPa and elastic strains slightly exceeding 2.0%. Only Cu47Ti33Zr11Ni8Si1 exhibits distinct plastic strain due to a unique composite microstructure with in situ formed nanoscale precipitates in the glassy matrix.",0
"The Bi2O3âB2O3âSiO2 glass solder was used to join the LiâTi ferrite. SEM micrographs of the joints showed the formation of FeBi5Ti3O15 whiskers at the interface. The formation mechanism was that the elements Fe and Ti reacted with [BiO6] units and came out as needle-like FeBi5Ti3O15 whiskers during cooling when the Ti content in the seam reached the critical concentration of crystallization. The quantity and morphology of the FeBi5Ti3O15 whiskers could be controlled by adjusting the bonding temperature and applied pressure, which could decide the Ti content in the seam. The deciduous ferrite ceramic particles were observed at the interface due to the formation of the FeBi5Ti3O15 whiskers continually consumed the elements Fe and Ti. Under the combined influence of the elements diffusion and interfacial reactions, nearly defect-free joints were obtained and a maximum in the shear strength of 92MPa was achieved at 750Â°C for 30min under 100Pa applied pressure.",0
"The van Hemmen model with transverse and random longitudinal field is studied to analyze the tricritical behavior in the quantum Ising spin glass at T=0. The free energy and order parameter are calculated for two types of probability distributions: Gaussian and bimodal. We obtain the phase diagram in the Î©âH plane, where Î© and H are the transverse and random longitudinal fields, respectively. For the case of Gaussian distribution the phase transition is of second order, while the bimodal distribution we observe second-order transition for high-transverse field and first-order transition for small transverse field, with a tricritical point in the phase diagram.",0
"The effects of MnO2 content on the structure and dielectric properties of the SBN-glass-ceramics were studied. The results show that a small amount of MnO2 doping of the SBN-glass-ceramics can make their microstructure become denser and more uniform and MnO2 doping of the SBN-glass-ceramics, as a grain growth inhibitor, has an evident effect on the reduction of grain sizes. The Mn ions exist in the form of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions in the SBN-glass-ceramics, as confirmed by XPS measurements and Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions easily form charge defect complexes, which causes the leakage current densities of the SBN-glass-ceramics to obviously decrease. And a small amount of MnO2 doping of the SBN-glass-ceramics can effectively decrease the dielectric loss of the materials. When 0.05mol% MnO2 is added to the SBN-glass-ceramics, the BDS is up to 1470.6kV/cm and the theoretical energy storage density reaches the maximum value of 9.2J/cm3.",0
"Gold-patterned glass substrates sealed to a PDMS fluidic layer is an architecture widely employed in microfluidic devices. The plasma bonding method is commonly used but presents the disadvantage of being ineffective on gold surfaces, creating a sealing weakness where solution leakage can be a problem. Frequently, alternative approaches to sealing include additional patterned layers that often require expensive cleanroom time. Here we demonstrate a sealing method involving carboxyl-terminated and amine-terminated silanes appropriate for PDMS-based device fabrication with patterned gold/glass surfaces. This cleanroom-free methodology improves solution leak pressure 37-fold compared to the standard plasma bonding technique on these patterned substrates. This bonding strategy is demonstrated in a proof-of-concept electrochemical cell enclosed in a PDMS chamber. An electrochemical method for preparing a clean and electroanalytically useful gold surface in the PDMS device is detailed.",0
"Metallic glasses of Ti20Zr20Cu50Ni10 in the form of hard ribbon were produced by the standard melt-spinning technique on copper roller wheel in air. Vacuum brazing using these ribbons were done to join two plates of Ti alloy at 990 K for a period of 10 min. The main aim of the present work was to study the use of the metallic glass ribbons as brazing material for titanium based alloys. Since the microstructure during crystallization of these metallic glasses is expected to influence the strength of brazing joints, microstructure characterization is very important. Here we present the results of characterization of the ribbons with Ti20Zr20Cu50Ni10 composition as well as the brazed sample after joining two Ti-plates. Both as-spun and heat-treated ribbon were characterized by X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached to both TEM and FESEM. The as-prepared ribbons showed amorphous nature when examined on both surfaces by XRD and as was also verified by TEM study of heat treated (753 K, 30 min.) ribbon showed formation of nanocrystalline microstructure comprised of equi-axed grains having sizes in the range of about 50-200 nm. Electron diffraction analysis in the TEM suggested the presence of two phases, viz., cubic Ti2Ni and (Ti, Zr)2Ni phases.",0
"A Si3N4/(W, Ti)C graded nano-composite ceramic tool material was developed and its high temperature flexural strength and fracture toughness were studied. With increased testing temperature, the flexural strength demonstrates a tendency to first decrease gradually and then decrease sharply, and the transition temperature is 1000â¯Â°C. The softening effect of glassy phases, the oxidation effect and the surface cracks result in the gradual decrease of flexural strength while the growth and merge of microcracks and cavities results in the sharp decrease. The fracture toughness under elevated temperatures increases gradually and then decreases dramatically, and the transition temperature is 1000â¯Â°C as well. The plastic deformation behavior, microcrack toughening effect and the healing effect of SiO2 layer result in the gradual increase of fracture toughness while liquefaction of the grain-boundary phase results in the sharp decrease. Due to reasonable composition distribution and induced compressive residual stress in the surface layers, the graded material shows a significantly better high temperature properties than the homogenous one.",0
"Zinc Lead Tungsten Tellurite (ZnPbWTe) glasses doped with different Pr3+ ion concentrations having the composition 5ZnOÂ +Â 15PbOÂ +Â 20WO3Â +Â (60-x)TeO2Â +Â xPr6O11 (where xâ¯=â¯0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5â¯mol%) were prepared by using sudden quenching technique and characterized to understand their visible emission characteristic features using spectroscopic techniques such as absorption, excitation and emission. The Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory has been applied to the absorption spectral features with an aim to evaluate various radiative properties for the prominent fluorescent levels of Pr3+ions in the as-prepared glasses. The emission spectra recorded for the as-prepared glasses under 468â¯nm excitation show three prominent emission transitions 3P0â3H6, 3P0â3F2 and 3P1â3F4, of which 3P0â3F2 observed in visible red region (648â¯nm), is relatively more intense. The intensity of 3P0â3F2 emission transition in the titled glasses increases up to 1mol% of Pr3+ ions and beyond concentration quenching is observed. Branching ratios (Î²R) and emission cross-sections (Ïse) were estimated for 3P0â3F2 transition to understand the luminescence efficiency in visible red region (648â¯nm). The CIE chromaticity coordinates were also evaluated in order to understand the suitability of these glasses for visible red luminescence devices. From the emission cross-sections, quantum efficiency and CIE coordinates, it was concluded that 1mol% of Pr3+ ions in ZnPbWTe glasses are quite suitable for preparing visible reddish orange luminescent devices.",1
"Fe-based metallic glass (FMG) particles reinforced Al-2024 matrix composites were fabricated by using the powder metallurgy method successfully. Mechanical alloying result in nanostructured Al-2024 matrix with a grain size of about 30nm together with a good distribution of the FMG particles in the Al matrix. The consolidation of the composites was performed at a temperature in the super-cooled liquid region of the FMG particles, where the FMG particles act as a soft liquid-like binder, resulting in composites with low or zero porosity. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and compression test. The yield and fracture strength of the composites are 403MPa and 660MPa, respectively, while retaining a considerable fracture deformation of about 12%. The strengthening mechanism is associated with the grain refinement of the matrix and uniform distribution of the FMG particles.",0
"Hadronization at finite temperature T is discussed in the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The differential cross-section for the conversion of a quark-antiquark pair into two pions to first order in a 1/N c expansion is calculated as a function of the c.m. energy s and temperature T. In particular, approaching the temperature T c of the chiral phase transition, the hadronization cross-section diverges like ln |1âT/T c |.",0
"The emission and life time decay characteristics of Eu3+ ions in barium boro-phosphate glasses mixed with different concentrations of Al2O3 are studied. The emission spectra exhibited bands due to 5D0 â 7F0, 7F1, 7F2, 7F3, 7F4 transitions of Eu3+ ions. The highest intensity of these transitions is observed when the glasses are mixed with 3.0mol% of Al2O3. Using the emission spectra, the JuddâOfelt (JâO) parameters and the radiative parameters viz., emission probability, A, the radiative lifetime, Ï, and the fluorescent branching ratio, Î² of different transitions originated from 5D0 level of Eu3+ ions are evaluated. The results have been analyzed as a function of Al2O3 concentration with the aid of IR spectral data. The IR spectral data have indicated that Al3+ ions participate in larger proportions in octahedral positions in the glasses mixed with 3.0mol% of Al2O3, which induce bonding defects, de-cluster the Eu3+ ions and facilitate for minimizing the emission losses due to quenching. The quantitative analysis of these results further indicated that 3.0mol% of Al2O3 is optimal for achieving the highest luminescence efficiency in these glasses.",1
"The synthesis and luminescence properties of various kind of rare earth borate glass were studied. These glasses were obtained by melting the mixture of H3BO3, ZnO and R2O3 (where R is rare earth) at 1150â1250Â°C for 2â3 hours. There are eight rare earth ions: Ce3+, Pr3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Er3+ and Tm3+ which give emission in the visible region of spectrum. The non-radiative transition probability and quantum efficiency were estimated from the measured decay times. The study of excitation spectra of doubly doped glasses indicates that energy transfers from Pr3+, Sm3+, Gd3+ to Eu3+ and from Ce3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ to Tb3+.",1
"Frequency and temperature dependent conductivity of mixed transition metal oxide (TMO) doped semiconducting glassy system, xV2O5â(1âx) (0.05MoO3â0.95ZnO) have been investigated in the wide range of frequency and temperature. The dc conductivity (Ïdc), crossover frequency (ÏH), frequency exponent (n) and power law exponent (s) have been computed from the best fitted plots of experimental data. We have estimated the values of activation energy of ac conduction (Eac) and free energy of polaron migration (EH). Dc conductivity of the as-prepared samples shows thermally activated nonâlinear nature, which has been interpreted with VogelâTammannâFulcher (VTF) model. From the fitting, pseudo activation energy (Ea) and thermodynamic ideal glass transition temperature (T0) have been estimated. Nature of variation of conductivity and the power law exponent (s) data exhibit that nonâoverlapping small polaron tunnelling (NSPT) model is suitable to interpret these data for compositions x=0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. On the other hand, correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model is most applicable mechanism for ac conduction for compositions x=0.9 and 0.93. Formation of some complex Mo-O-V structures may be possible reason for applicability of CBH model for composition x=0.9, 0.93. It is also observed that conductivity relaxation process of charge carriers (polarons) is independent of temperature, but depends upon composition.",0

"About 250Â nm-thick Ni-doped ZnO:Al films were deposited on glass substrates at 300Â K, 473Â K and 673Â K by direct current magnetron co-sputtering. Atomic ratio of Zn:Al:Ni in the film is 100:5:4. All the films have a ZnO wurtzite structure and grow mainly with their crystallographic c-axis perpendicular to the substrate. The films deposited at 300Â K and 673Â K consist of granular grains whereas the film grown at 473Â K mainly has a dense columnar structure. The Ni-doped ZnO:Al film grown at 473Â K has the lowest resistivity of 7.7Ã10â3Â Î©cm. All the films have an average optical transmittance of over 90% in the visible wavelength range. The absorption edge of the film grown at 473Â K shifts to the shorter wavelength (blueshift) relative to those deposited at 300Â K and 673Â K. When the substrate temperature reaches 673Â K, the Ni-doped ZnO:Al film shows a magnetization curve at room temperature, indicating that the film has a hard magnetization characteristic. The saturation magnetization is about 1Ã10â4Â T and the saturation field is about 3.2Ã105Â A/m.",0
"In situ MgâCuâYâZn bulk metallic glass (BMG) matrix composites, in which Mg solid solution flakes of 0.5â1Î¼m thickness and 2â10Î¼m length are dispersed, have been prepared by copper mold casting. The Mg flakes are characterized as a long-period order structure (LOS), i.e. periodic arrays of six close-packed planes distorted from the ideal hexagonal lattice of 6H-type. The formation mechanism of LOS is interpreted as the precipitation of the leading phase of the eutectic reaction above the glass transition temperature. In comparison with monolithic Mg-based BMG alloys, the composites with an LOS exhibit significant improvement in mechanical properties, e.g. a compressive plastic strain of â¼18% and ultimate strength of â¼1.2GPa, have been measured in Mg81Cu9.3Y4.7Zn5 alloy. It is suggested that the enhancement of the mechanical properties of the composites can be attributed to the generation of multiple shear bands and the deformation of the LOS.",0
"We have used a combination of ultrasound processor and 3-roll shear mixer to disperse 0.2â0.4wt.% functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-NH2) in SC-15 epoxy with and without acetone media. Epoxy and e-glass/epoxy composites were prepared with this modified resin. In addition, control composites without MWCNT were also prepared for baseline comparison. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), rheology, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and flexure tests were conducted. Effective dispersion of MWCNTs achieved through solvent media, and the enhanced interfacial interaction between epoxy and amine functional groups of MWCNTs lead to optimum increase in DMTA and flexural properties of composites. Micrographic analyses revealed bridging of MWCNTs with epoxy and rougher fracture surfaces in epoxy composites. Also, a better interfacial bonding was observed in MWCNT incorporated e-glass/epoxy samples over control samples.",0
Energy transfer from optically excited divalent manganese to trivalent praseodymium in phosphate glass has been observed. Large values of transfer efficiencies and transfer probabilities suggest that Mn2+ can be a good sensitizer for Pr3+ in phosphate glass. The energy transfer mechanism is found to be mainly electric dipole-dipole in nature.,1
Highly Er3+-doped fluoride glass ceramics planar waveguides containing LaF3 nanocrystals have been fabricated by physical vapor deposition (PVD). The solubility of Er3+ in the segregated nanocrystals can reach 30mol% which is much larger than the value found in LaF3-oxide glass ceramics. A quantitative analysis of the photoluminescence of the 1.54Î¼m emission band of Er3+ ions has demonstrated that erbium ions are partitioned in both crystals and vitreous phase. The short lifetime (2.2ms) measured for erbium incorporated in LaF3 crystal lattice is a consequence of concentration quenching while the lifetime is close to 10ms in the glassy phase. The emission bandwidth has been found to be greater than that of the precursor glass (71nm at the half-height width). The high Er3+ concentration and spectral width could make this nanostructured fluoride material suitable for planar amplifier in the C telecommunication band.,1
"Four Ni-bearing Ti, Zr and Hf ternary alloys of nominal composition Zr41.5Ti41.5Ni17, Zr25Ti25Ni50, Zr41.5Hf41.5Ni17 and Ti41.5Hf41.5Ni17 were rapidly solidified in order to produce ribbons. The ZrâTiâNi and TiâHfâNi alloys become amorphous, whereas the ZrâHfâNi alloy shows precipitation of a cubic phase. The devitrification of all three alloys was followed and the relative tendency to form nanoquasicrystals and cF96 phases analysed. The relative glass-forming ability of the alloys can be explained by taking into account their atomic size difference. Addition of Ni often leads to quasicrystallisation or quasicrystal-related phases. This can be explained by the atomic radius and heat of mixing of the constituent elements. The phases precipitated at the initial stages of crystallisation indicate the possible presence of FrankâKasper polyhedral structure in the amorphous alloys. Structural analysis reveals that the Laves and the anti-Laves phases have the same polyhedral structural unit, which is similar to the structural characteristics of glass.",0
"A ductile phase-separated Zr-based bulk metallic glass (BMG) deformed to different strains at room temperature and low strain rate was characterized. The BMG samples were compressed to nominal strains of 3%, 7%, and 10%, after which the samples were unloaded for morphological observation using scanning electron microscopy. The morphological observation was subsequently used for the interpretation of the measured loadâdisplacement curves. It was found that the BMG exhibited apparent uniform deformation initially (at plastic strain <1%) and, then, visible local shear bands began to developed. Afterwards, a principal shear band was soon developed and dominated the deformation process until fracture. In this study, we also found that the local shear strain varies along the principal shear plane and decreases monotonically from the shear band initiation site.",0
"Post-consumer poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET) material has been recycled in an upgrading procedure. Radiation treatment of modest dose (10kGy) has been applied to activate a reactive additive (epoxy-acrylate, 2% to the PET) to bond together the matrix (recycled PET) and the reinforcement (chopped glass fiber, 10â20% to the PET). Tensile-, bending- and impact-resistance of the treated, recycled PET has been improved significantly. A new composite engineering material has been manufactured this way of reactive reinforcing recycling, surpassing the original, virgin PET especially in impact properties. The new thermoplastic is well suitable for injection molding of technical parts.",0
"Previous studies have well demonstrated that recycled glass (RG) can be incorporated into cementitious materials to replace 100% river sand as fine aggregates. However, this replacement was found to incur adverse effects on the mechanical properties of the cement mortar. In this study, CO2 curing was employed to ameliorate these drawbacks. The effect of CO2 curing on both of the mechanical properties and microstructure of the RG incorporated cement mortar was studied by a series of laboratory tests. The results showed that replacement of river sand by 100% RG led to a 37% decrease in compressive strength and a 32% reduction in flexural strength of the mortar samples under conventional curing. Whereas, CO2 curing of these samples significantly enhanced both the compressive and flexural strength, with a more pronounced improvement on the former. Such improvements were further reflected by a decrease in both the water absorption and porosity, and by an enhancement of the microstructure. This is attributed to the fact that compared with the mortar samples prepared with 100% river sand, those prepared with 100% RG had a more porous structure due to the smooth surface of RG and thus a poor bonding between the RG and the cement paste. However, such a porous structure encouraged CO2 gas to penetrate and diffuse more easily into the cementitious matrix, resulting in a higher degree of CO2 curing.",0
The up-conversion properties of Tm3+/Yb3+ codoped oxyfluoride glass-ceramics under 980 nm excitation were investigated. Intense blue up-conversion luminescence due to the Tm3+: 1G4 â 3H6 transition was observed in the glass-ceramics. The intensity of the blue up-conversion luminescence in a 1 mol% YbF3-containing glass-ceramic was found to be about 40 times stronger than that in the precursor oxyfluoride glass. The up-conversion mechanism is proposed. The reason for the intense Tm3+ up-conversion luminescence in the oxyfluoride glass-ceramics and the concentrations dependence of upconversion luminescence are also discussed.,1
"The mechanism of phase separation, nucleation and crystallization of the two glasses in the system K2O â MgO â A12O3 â B2O3 â SiO2 â F â CaO â P2O5 are investigated and discussed in detail. The results of DTA, SEM/EDAX, XRD and IR analyses reveal that a multiple phase setaration takes place in the parent glasses due to the asymetry of immiscibility dome. Many still smaller silicatesârich droplet phases are separated secondarily from the original phosphates â rich phases primarily separated from the matrix phase. The two main crystalline phase are formed in different phases separated and they are with different nucleation mechanisms.",1
"We have investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Mn3Cu1âx Sn x N(x=0, 0.5) using first-principles density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) + U schemes. The crystal structure of the compounds is tetragonal crystal for x=0 while it is a cubic crystal for x=0.5. Our spin-polarized calculations give a metallic ground state for the x= 0, 0.5 in agreement with experiments. From the charge density and density of states(DOS), the coupling between Sn 5p with Mn 3d and spin geometrical frustration effect are the main reasons for magnetic transition in Mn3Cu1âx Sn x N.",0
"Theoretical estimates and experimental data indicate that the new high Tc Oxides have an extremely short coherence length, of the order of the size of the unit cell. In contrast with the formerly known superconductors, this short coherence length gives rise to a new behavior of the superconducting order parameter, including large thermodynamic fluctuations in the vicinity of Tc and a strongly enhanced sensitivity to local defects. In particular, the order parameter is strongly depressed at the boundaries, including external surfaces and internal planar defects such as twin boundaries. This depression is most pronounced at high temperatures where the coherence length becomes larger than the extrapolation length. The boundaries act effectively as pair breaker, leading to a smeared density of states, suppressed surface superconductivity, reduced critical densities and to the glassy behavior for which there is considerable experimental evidence. The latter may be understood as resulting from the existence of an irregular network of internal Josephson junctions located at twin boundaries or other planar defects. Recent experiments pointing out to a quantitative correlation between twin boundaries density and superconducting properties will be reviewed.",0
"We synthesized a batch of co-doped (Ce3++Sm3+): LBZ glass specimens by melt quenching process and their structural and radiation properties were studied by employing XRD, FE-SEM, optical absorption, photoluminescence and lifetime measurements. UVâVisâNIR absorption studies of the co-doped (Ce3++Sm3+): LBZ glassy matrix displays pertinent bands of both Ce3+ and Sm3+ ions. Individually doped Sm3+: LBZ glass exhibit bright orange emission at 603â¯nm (4G5/2 â 6H7/2) under the excitation of 403â¯nm. Nevertheless, the luminescence intensities pertaining to Sm3+ were extraordinarily increased by co-doping with Ce3+ ions to Sm3+: LBZ glassy matrices because of energy transfer from Ce3+ to Sm3+. The fluorescence spectra of co-doped (Ce3++Sm3+): LBZ exhibits characteristic emission bands of Ce3+ (441â¯nm, blue) and Sm3+ (603â¯nm, reddish orange) under the excitation of 362â¯nm. Decay curves of Ce3+ and Sm3+ ions in co-doped glass has been fitted to double exponential nature. The decreasing lifetime of donor ion and rising lifetime of acceptor ion in double doped glass could support the energy transfer from Ce3+ to Sm3+ ions in the host matrix. The CIE coordinates and CCT values were calculated for all the obtained co-doped glassy samples from their luminescence spectra. By adding Ce3+ ions to individually doped Sm3+: LBZ glass matrix, the emitting color changes from reddish orange to white light which resembles the energy transfer from Ce3+ to Sm3+ ions. These studies, perhaps implied that attained co-doped (Ce3++Sm3+): LBZ glassy samples are potential materials for white lighting appliances.",1
"In this work, a controlled uni-directional heat flow was realized during the bulk metallic glasses preparation by using a vertical Bridgman solidification apparatus. Fully amorphous Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 bulk metallic glass specimens were prepared. The obvious difference in hardness between the cross and longitudinal sections of the as-prepared Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 bulk metallic glass specimens was identified, indicating strong mechanical anisotropy. The observed anisotropy can be ascribed to the uni-directional heat flow during the process of Bridgman solidification. The mechanical anisotropy may be explained by the free volume theory.",0
"TiO2 is a widely used electron transport layer for high efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, many intrinsic shortcomings seriously deteriorate the devices performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile and effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance by passivating the TiO2 mesoporous layer with a nanoscale dispersed 12-tungstophosphoric heteropolyacid (H3PW12O40Â·nH2O). Due to the strong interaction between H3PW12O40Â·nH2O and TiO2, the passivated TiO2 mesoporous electron transport layer (hereafter denoted as PW12/TiO2) with an optimal weight ratio shows a more uniform coverage on the underlying substrate in comparison with the bare TiO2. Furthermore, the resulted PW12/TiO2 also shows an obviously improved conductivity and significantly increased photoluminescence quenching for the perovskite emission. Thereby, this strategy leads to an apparently improved photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiency enhancement from 15.05% to 18.20%. In conclusion, our present study provides an effective approach for further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells by passivating the mesoporous electron transport layer with the well-known heteropolyacids.",0
"In this work, effects of YF3 addition on the formation and optical properties of Er3+ doped fluoride nanocrystals in glassâceramics were studied. Results obtained from X-ray diffraction patterns, absorption spectra and emission spectra all showed that Y3+ ions promoted the preferential incorporation of Er3+ ions into the fluoride nanocrystals and decreased the effective concentration of Er3+ ions inside the fluoride nanocrystals. As a result, concentration dependent energy transfer processes were suppressed and efficiency of 2.73Î¼m emission was improved.",1
"Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu12.5Zn5 and Zr65Al7.5Ni5Cu17.5Zn5 metallic glasses, which were obtained by adding Zn to the well-known glass-former Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu17.5, were prepared by a melt-spinning method and the crystallization process was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Two exothermic peaks were observed in the DSC curves. The low temperature one corresponds to the simultaneous precipitation of an icosahedral quasicrystalline phase (I-phase) and the face centered cubic Zr2Ni (FCCâZr2Ni) phase in the Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu12.5Zn5 alloy. The initial precipitate for the Zr65Al7.5Ni5Cu17.5Zn5 alloy is a single I-phase. Since an I-phase does not occur in the crystallization process of Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu17.5 metallic glass, the present results demonstrate that the addition of Zn is effective in promoting the precipitation of an I-phase, in addition to the previously reported noble metals. Further annealing leads to the precipitation of other stable crystalline phases, indicating the metastable character of the I-phase and the FCCâZr2Ni phase. The reason for the change in the crystallization process caused by the addition of Zn was discussed on the basis of the chemical affinity and atomic radius of the constituent elements.",0
"Dielectric characterization of the Î±-relaxation in polyarylate (PAr) has been carried out by means of a dielectric spectroscopy technique in a frequency range of 10â30 kHz. Complementary thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) and differential scanning calorimetry d.s.c.) measurements have also been performed. The results are interpreted in terms of the standard Cole-Cole plot and Havriliak-Negami distribution for the dielectric relaxation times. Information about the temperature and frequency dependence of a.c. conductivity is also obtained from the experimental curves. However, the behaviour of the main dielectric relaxation time is deduced from the experimental data in a wide range of temperature around the glass transition. This behaviour results in close agreement with the theoretical predictions of a free-volume approach for the dielectric Î±-relaxation recently proposed by the authors.",0
"The effect of low amounts of Cr on glass forming ability and corrosion behavior of Fe(65â x )Cr x Mo14C15B6 (x =0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10at.%) ribbons have been studied. It was found that the reduced glass transition temperature (Trg ) do not change significantly with Cr content. The glass forming ability (GFA) of this system is evaluated by the Î³m , Î´ and Ï parameters and the alloys containing 4 and 6at.% were found to be the best glass formers in this system. The temperature interval of the supercooled liquid region (ÎTx ) changed with Cr and was enlarged from 35K at x =0 to 50K at x =4. Corrosion rates measured by immersion tests in H2SO4 decreased with an increase of chromium content in the alloys. The electrochemical measurements indicate that the alloys containing more than 4at.% of Cr are spontaneously passivated with low current densities in 0.1N H2SO4 whereas the alloys with Cr content <4at.% showed transpassive Mo dissolution. In view of these results, the optimal amount of Cr addition in FeâMoâCâB amorphous steels is discussed.",0
"Glasses of the K2OZnOAl2O3 SiO2 system co-doped with Eu2O3 and Yb2O3 were prepared by the melt-quenching technique. Transparent zincite (ZnO) glassâceramics were obtained by secondary heat-treatments at 680â860Â Â°C. At 860Â Â°C, traces of Eu oxyapatite appeared in addition to ZnO nanocrystals. The average crystal size obtained from the X-ray diffraction data was found to range between 14 and 35Â nm. Absorption spectra of the initial glasses are composed of an absorption edge and absorption bands due to electronic transitions of Eu3+ ions. With heat-treatment, the absorption edge pronouncedly shifts to the visible spectral range. The luminescence properties of the glass and glass-ceramics were studied by measuring their excitation and emission spectra at 300, 78, and 4.2Â K. Strong red emission of Eu3+ ions dominated by the 5D0â7F2 (612Â nm) electric dipole transition was detected. Changes in the luminescence properties of the Eu3+-related excitation and emission bands were observed after heat-treatments at 680Â Â°C and 860Â Â°C. The ZnO nanocrystals showed both broad luminescence (400â850Â nm) and free-exciton emission near 3.3Â eV at room temperature. The upconversion luminescence spectrum of the initial glass was obtained under excitation of the 976Â nm laser source.",1
"The Î±-relaxation behaviour of polymers and glass forming viscous liquids is well described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation, introducing a Vogel temperature T 0 at which the relaxation time ÏÎ± diverges (T 0 â T g - 50 K). With the recent development of the mode coupling theory a new critical temperature T c is introduced located about 50 to 80 K above T g. The relevance of the various temperatures is discussed on the basis of dynamic light scattering studies and dielectric relaxation data. The dynamic and static light scattering experiments revealed some unexpected features, which cannot be explained on the basis of conventional liquid state theories: (1) In static light scattering the intensity I(qâ0) is no longer proportional to the isothermal compressibility. (2) This excess scattering I exc shows a strong q-dependence (q = (4Ïn/Î»)sin(Î¸/2)) corresponding to a correlation length Î¾ in the range of 20â200 nm. (3) The Landau-Placzek ratio I Rayleigh/2I Brillouin is much too high, compared with the results of light scattering theories. (4) In photon correlation spectroscopy a new ultraslow hydrodynamic mode (Îâ¼q 2) is detected with relaxation rates Î about 10-4 to 10-7 lower than those of the Î±-process at a given temperature. These effects are caused by long density fluctuations indicating a nonhomogeneous distribution of free volume. The redistribution of free volume in space causes the new ultraslow mode. A tentative model is proposed which describes the long range density fluctuations as a result of the coexistence of molecules with two different dynamic states, which show up in the Fabry-Perot and Raman spectroscopy.",0
"The mode II shear behavior of a glass fabric/epoxy composite and a multiscale hybrid glass fabric/epoxy composite containing Multi Walled Carbon Nano Tubes (MWCNT) are compared here in the interlaminar mode of loading. The thick composites were fabricated through the vacuum bagging technique and two sets of specimens were prepared with and without carbon nano tubes. One set of each of these specimens were prepared with a TeflonÂ® film crack initiator at the end of the specimens exactly at the centroidal line of the laminate to study the fracture behavior and strain energy release rates. This study addresses the issue of testing thick laminated composites and thick multiscale laminated composites in Mode II Inter Laminar Shear (ILS). The Inter Laminar Shear Strengths (ILSS) of these composites were evaluated. The theories on the strain energy release rate are also revisited and useful conclusions drawn regarding the applicability of the same to multiscale composites loaded in the ILS test set up. Thus, a comparison is made between the mode II behavior in flexure and ILS of these composites.",0
"A magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) investigation of the environments of 29Si, 31P and 23Na, in glasses from the Na2Oî¸CaOî¸SiO2î¸(6 wt% P2O5) system, has shown that the distribution of non-bridging oxygens can be described by a binary distribution of Q2 and Q3 silicon species. The changes in the chemical shifts of these two species with composition are interpreted as resulting from the preferential association of Na+ with Q3 and Ca2+ with Q2. It is suggested that it is this partitioning that determines bioactivity by controlling the dissolution, hydrolysis and condensation reactions which occur at the interface between the glass and the physiological environment.",1
"We propose a GaSbî¸AlSbî¸InAs quantum-well structure to study the semiconductor-excitonic insulator phase transition. The wide-gap compound AlSb serves as an energy barrier for both electrons in the InAs quantum-well and holes in the GaSb quantum-well in the excitonic phase. The exciton binding energy is calculated by a variational method and is found to decrease with the barrier width and much slower with the well widths. The variational parameter Î», which determines the exciton extension, is shown to increase with the barrier width.",0
"Zinc Alumino Bismuth Borate (ZnAlBiB) glasses doped with terbium (Tb3+) ions with a chemical composition 20ZnOâ10Al2O3â(10âx)Bi2O3â60B2O3âxTb2O3 (x=0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0mol%) were prepared by a conventional melt quenching method and studied their optical absorption, photoluminescence and decay spectral properties. The JuddâOfelt (JâO) parameters evaluated from the experimental oscillator strengths were used to measure the radiative properties for the prominent luminescent transitions of Tb3+ ions such as 5D4â7F6, 7F5, 7F4 and 7F3. The effect of Tb3+ ion concentration on the luminescence process observed in the visible region was discussed in detail. The emission spectra recorded for all the ZnAlBiB glasses doped with Tb3+ ions, show an intense peak in green region at 542nm. The stimulated emission cross-section, branching ratios and quantum efficiency values evaluated for green emission (5D4â7F5) suggests the utility of these glasses for green luminescence applications. It was found that, within the concentration range investigated, 2.5mol% of Tb3+ doped ZnAlBiB glass is most suitable for green luminescence applications at 542nm in principle.",1
"Sodium phosphoniobate glasses with the composition (mol%) 75NaPO3â25Nb2O5 and containing 2mol% Yb3+ and x mol% Er3+ (0.01â©½ x â©½2) were prepared using the conventional melting/casting process. Er3+ emission at 1.5Î¼m and infrared-to-visible upconversion emission, upon excitation at 976nm, are evaluated as a function of the Er3+ concentration. For the lowest Er3+ content, 1.5Î¼m emission quantum efficiency was 90%. Increasing the Er3+ concentration up to 2mol%, the emission quantum efficiency was observed to decrease to 37% due to concentration quenching. The green and red upconversion emission intensity ratio was studied as a function of Yb3+ co-doping and the Er3+âEr3+ energy transfer processes.",1
"In this work, processing of molybdenum and tungsten by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is analyzed. The study reveals the impact of the oxygen content of the powder, the process atmosphere and the temperature of the substrate plate on the structural and mechanical properties of the processed material. For clarifying the causes and mechanisms for the formation of defects in molybdenum and tungsten processed by SLM, the samples were examined by x-ray, scanning and transmission electron microscopy including elemental distribution maps and crystallographic analyses by electron backscatter diffraction. Impurities, mainly oxygen, were identified as cause for the predominant defect structure comprising cracks and residual porosity. During processing, oxygen in the form of molybdenum/tungsten oxide, segregates at the grain boundaries, thereby inducing hot cracking. This is due to the lower melting point of the eutectic compared to the matrix phase. Moreover, the oxygen impurities were found to weaken the grain boundaries and thus increasing the risk for cold cracking and leading to a higher Ductile-to-Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT). Subsequently, the combination of cracks through hot cracking at planar solidified grain boundaries and cold cracking along weakened grain boundaries during rapid cooling from the melting point creates the crack network generally found in molybdenum and tungsten processed by SLM. Also a substrate plate temperature of 1000â¯Â°C does not prevent the formation of cracks in tungsten caused by oxygen segregations.",0
"Un temps de transition entre deux activitÃ©s constitue pour lâadulte un espace bien particulier, un entre-deux. Pour lâenfant, il sâagit dâun temps comme un autre. Ce moment, qui rime souvent avec organisation et efficacitÃ©, comprend aussi un risque de douces violences quâil est important dâidentifier.",0
"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is one of the most sensitive methods for the detection of adsorbed molecules on the nanostructured coinage-metal surface. The enhancements in the order of 104â106 are routinely observed. Such an effect makes SERS spectroscopy a technique applicable to the study the adsorption of analytes in the submonolayer regime. Novel SERS sensors require novel substrates with high activity for great sensibility detection of different molecules applied in many fields, such as detections of narcotics, explosives, and molecules with biological interest. In this work, silver nanoparticles embedded in niobium lead-pyrophosphate glasses (Pb2P2O7-Nb2O5-Na2O) were prepared by ion exchange process, where silver ions were introduced into glass surface by Ag+/Na+ ion exchange (NaNO3:AgNO3 batch), and reduced to metallic silver by heat treatment at glass transition temperature (ca. 480âÂ°C). The new substrate was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, optical absorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Its application in SERS was demonstrated by studying the adsorption of 2,2-bipyridine (bpy) on the glass surface, which has marker bands for the coordination of the adsorbate with silver atoms. The optimal surface features in terms of SERS enhancement were also discussed and the sensing ability of this new substrate was demonstrated.",1
"Wear testing of glass ceramics and Gr15 bearing steel materials were performed in a wear tester was performed. Under different loaded conditions, friction coefficient and wear rate of glass-ceramics were tested and the morphologies of worn surfaces of glass-ceramics were observed by using the optical microscope. The wear theory of glass-ceramics was analyzed, and then the experimental result was gotten. It showed that the friction coefficient was lower when the load was lower. As wear load increased, the friction coefficients increased and tended to stability. The average friction coefficient of fluorophlogopite glass ceramics and bearing steel are equal to 0.095. There existed variety on wear rate between glass ceramics and bearing steel. Between glass ceramics and bearing steel materials, abrasive wear was the main wear form.",1
"A stress-corrosion-cracking (S.C.C.) model has been applied to an analysis of the flexural fatigue behaviour of water-aged unidirectional glass/epoxy composites. The approach has been restricted to the initial stages of the fatigue life, i.e. when the damage consists mainly in the accumulation of broken glass fibres at the microscopic level. The fatigue behaviour of the aged material has been investigated at different strain levels, frequencies and strain ratios. The results demonstrate that the stiffness loss exhibits some of the main characteristic features which can be deduced from the delayed failure of a statistical population of glass fibres by a S.C.C. mechanism. This approach was supported by microscope observations which revealed that, within the investigated time range, the stiffness loss is proportional to the density of broken fibres in the vicinity of the loading point.",0
"The rare earth doped borosilicate glass materials of composition (60â¯ââ¯x) B2O3â¯ââ¯20 SiO2â¯ââ¯10 Na2Oâ¯ââ¯10 MgOâ¯ââ¯x Dy2O3 have been prepared by melt quenching method. X-ray diffraction confirms the amorphous nature of the present glasses. FTIR spectra reveal the structure of the present glasses. The density, molar volume, average molecular weight, ion concentration, polaron radius and field strength have been determined. The optical parameters like optical band gap, refractive index, dielectric constant, optical dielectric constant, molar polarizability, reflection loss, molar refractivity, metallization and Urbach energy were also calculated. The glow curve behavior of all the present glass samples irradiated with 50â¯Gy, 100â¯Gy, 500â¯Gy, 1â¯kGy, 5â¯kGy and 10â¯kGy gamma ray doses has been investigated in temperature range 50â400Â°C. The TL dose response shows that the sample having 0.6â¯mol% doping of Dy3+ was best suitable for dosimetric applications.",1
"Glasses of composition 55P2O5â(45-x)Na2OâxK2O; (5â¤ x â¤25) have been prepared by melt-quench technique. The broad halo in all quenched samples indicates their amorphous nature as confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction. The mixed glass modifiers effect (MGME) on crystallization and thermal stability are investigated using the differential thermal analyzer under non-isothermal conditions. The kinetic of crystallization has been studied using Kissinger's and AugisâBennett models. The activation energies for glass transition (E g) and crystallization (E c) are observed maximum for 10 and 20mol% K2O glasses. 10 and 20mol% K2O contained glasses exhibit minimum crystallization frequency than other glasses, which indicate their higher kinetic and thermodynamic stability. FTIR and Raman analysis confirmed the higher polymerization of phosphate groups in 10 and 20mol% K2O glasses as compared to other glasses.",1
"Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin films were deposited on glass substrates at room temperature by RF magnetron sputtering. The effects of Ar gas pressure on the structural, optical, and electrical properties were investigated. As the Ar gas pressure increased, the resistivities of the AZO thin films increased, the mobilities decreased, and the carrier concentrations were constant. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that higher Ar gas pressures promoted OâZn bond formation and reduced the number of oxygen vacancies. The reduction in mobility, which increased the resistivity, was attributed to increased lattice scattering by the oxygen atoms. In AZO thin films deposited at room temperature, the conduction characteristics are primarily influenced by the mobility.",0
"The interface interaction between reinforcing glass fibers and a brittle silicate matrix is the key parameter influencing mechanical behavior of lime-based fiber-reinforced mortars. Most glass fibers are industrially sized by a smooth layer of polymer-based coating causing poor adhesion between fibers and the matrix. This study examined oxygen plasma etching of glass fibers sized by aminosilane. Modified fibers were observed using SEM microscopy to reveal changes in their morphologies. Chemical changes were detected using contact angle measurement with samples wetted by water. To reveal the interaction between fibers and the matrix, mechanical destructive tests were conducted on prismatic fiber-reinforced mortar samples. Sized fiber surfaces were slightly roughened and activated. Loading tests revealed that bending and the compressive strength of lime-based mortars reinforced with treated fibers performed more poorly than those with reference fibers.",0
"The paucity of structural defects in carbon nanotube (CNT) with unrivalled mechanical properties has always posed an interest to material scientists for its potential incorporation in soft polymer resins to achieve superior mechanical stability. Present investigation focuses on the assessment of flexural behaviour of glass/epoxy (GE) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) embedded glass/epoxy (0.3Â wt. % of epoxy) (CNT-GE) composites at different in-service environmental temperatures. In-situ 3-point bend tests were performed on GE and CNT-GE composites atÂ â80Â Â°C,Â â40Â Â°C, room temperature (20Â Â°C), 70Â Â°C and 110Â Â°C temperatures at 1Â mm/min crosshead speed. The results revealed that at 110Â Â°C temperature, the flexural strength of GE and CNT-GE composites was significantly decreased by 67% and 81% respectively in comparison to their strength atÂ â80Â Â°C temperature. Similarly, 38% and 77% decrement in modulus was noted for GE and CNT-GE composites respectively. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was carried out in the temperature range ofÂ â100Â Â°C to 200Â Â°C to correlate the mechanical and thermo-mechanical response of both the material systems. Addition of 0.3Â wt. % MWCNT in GE composite resulted in lowering of glass transition temperature (Tg) by 12Â Â°C. Furthermore, to understand various possible deformation and failure mechanisms, the post failure analysis of the fractured specimens, tested at different temperatures, was carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The critical parameters needed during designing composite structures were calculated and modelled using Weibull constitutive model.",0
"The purpose of this study is the recycling or reuse of waste materials in the production of ternary blended cement mortars (TBCMs) by a partial substitution of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with a ratio of 20% waste glass powder (WG) to obtain a blended cement (80% OPC: 20% WG). Three different ratios of rice husk ash namely 2.5%, 5%, and 10% are added to obtain three TBCMs as well as conventional cement mortar CM (zero % of rice husk ash). The specimens of all mortars are cured under tap water for different periods of time namely 3, 7, 28, 60, and 90 days. The influence of amorphous silica present in both waste glass and rice husk ash on the performance of TBCMs is studied. The results emphasized that both the waste glass and rice husk ash has a positive effect in the improvement of the compressive strength values of all mortar specimens with increasing hydration time. While the physical parameters such as total porosity and water absorption percentages decreased. The results also indicated that for any given hydration time, the compressive strength values of TBCMs are higher than those of CM. The noticeable improvement in the compressive strength is for TBCM2 specimens (5% rice husk ash). On the other hand, the influence of gamma-irradiation doses on physico-mechanical properties of unsaturated polyester (UP)/impregnated blended cement mortar composite specimens (TBCMs) is studied. The obtained data showed an enhancement in the mechanical properties of the irradiated specimens as compared to unirradiated ones. Furthermore, the thermal stability of TBCMs is studied by using thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results are also confirmed by XRD analysis.",0
"In this paper, the damage development process of glassâepoxy laminated composite pinned-joints is investigated. To determine the effects of joint geometry and stacking sequence on the bearing strength and damage mode, experimental studies were carried out. Two different geometrical parameters which are the edge distance-to-hole diameter ratio (E/D) and plate width-to hole diameter ratio (W/D) were considered. Hence, E/D and W/D ratios were selected from 1 to 5 and 2 to 5, respectively. By observing the effect of material parameters on damage development, composite laminated plates were stacked as two different orientations, [ 0 Â° / 90 2 Â° / 0 Â° ] s and [0Â°/90Â°]2 s . A total of 144 specimens with nine different geometries were tested to obtain the experimental strength and failure mode. Damage progression was examined by using scanning electron microscopy on specimens loaded to ultimate failure and to percentages of their ultimate failure load.",0
"Mechanical alloying of an Fe-based bulk metallic glass composition (Fe60Co8Zr10Mo5W2B15) was conducted starting from blended elemental powders. A supersaturated solid solution of all the alloying elements in Fe has formed in the initial stages of milling. This Î±-Fe phase became amorphous on subsequent milling up to 20â30h. Further milling, unexpectedly, led to primary crystallization of the amorphous phase resulting in the formation of an (Î±-Fe)â² phase with a slightly smaller lattice parameter (and lower solute content) than that in the early stages of milling. External annealing of the amorphous phase powder at 700Â°C for 1h led to complete crystallization of the amorphous phase into a mixture of phases including Î±-Fe, ZrFe2, Fe2B, Fe3B, MoB2, FeMo2B2, and at least another unidentified phase. Possible reasons for such an unusual amorphous â crystalline transformation on milling in the bulk metallic glass composition are discussed and it was shown that this transformation is due to the combination of defect-assisted diffusion and a slight rise in the powder temperature.",0
"A range of phase-separating Zr-La-Cu-Ni-Al alloys has been cast. The Zr-based alloys show a dispersion of La-based, partially amorphous spheres in a Zr-based glassy matrix while the La-based alloys consist of Zr-based, crystalline spheres in a La-based glassy matrix. Compression testing reveals embrittlement in the former alloys, but toughening in the latter. The observed behaviour is explained by considering the toughness of the reinforcing phase, in comparison to the glassy matrix.",0
"Statement of problem. Lining and base materials for restorations have traditionally been autopolymerized and include conventional glass ionomer cements. Light-cured resin-modified glass ionomer cements have recently become available, but a lack of information exists regarding their radiopacity. Purpose of study. In this study the radiopacity of glass ionomer cements was assessed with a standard method that related densitometric measurements to an equivalent thickness of aluminum. Material and methods. Radiographs were made of specimens with seven materials commonly used as liners and bases: two reinforced zinc oxideâeugenol cements (Kalzinol and Intermediate Restorative Material, De Trey Dentsply), a zinc phosphate cement (SS White, S.S. White Manufacturing), three resin-modified glass ionomer liners (Vitrebond [3M Dental Products], Fuji Lining LC [GC Dental], and Photac-Bond [ESPE Dental Medizin GmbH]), and a conventional glass ionomer liner/base (Ketac-Bond, ESPE Dental-Medizin GmbH), with dentin as a control. The radiopacity of all materials was compared with dentin. Results. Kalzinol had the greatest radiopacity of the materials tested. The glass ionomer cements were substantially less radiopaque than other materials. The conventional glass ionomer cement, Ketac-Bond, was more radiopaque than the three resin-modified glass ionomer cements. Of the three resin-modified glass ionomer materials, Vitrebond was the most radiopaque and Fuji Lining LC was the least radiopaque. Conclusion. Future resin-modified glass ionomer materials are recommended to be formulated to increase radiopacity for improved clinical detection. (J Prosthet Dent 1997;77:239-42.)",0
"Neutron inelastic triple-axis spectra of CD3OD/6%D2O in the glassy and liquid phases are reported. Both the dispersion and damping of the sound modes show characteristic features as the temperature is lowered to the glassy regime. Furthermore, analysis of the observed scattering intensities reveals the presence in the glass of a second component centred at zero frequency which is not observed in the liquid.",0
"Ti-Ni-Cu-Zr-based crystal/glassy dual-phase alloy samples with different sizes and good mechanical properties were manufactured. The structure of these samples was examined via X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy. The developed dual-phase structure alloys combine the high strength of glassy alloys and plasticity of crystalline alloys. Plastic deformation was enhanced by this dual-phase structure. Mechanical characterization of the alloys revealed three deformation stages, namely a martensitic transformation, dislocation slip in a crystalline phase, and shear deformation of the glassy matrix. Two types of effects involving the martensitic transformation were observed: superelastic behavior and the transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect, which provide an additional deformation mechanism and lead to a significant increase in the plasticity of these dual-phase samples. The results indicate that the fraction of glassy phase occurring in large rods formed at lower cooling rates is lower than that occurring in smaller rods; therefore, the deformation-induced martensitic transformation of the crystalline cP2 phase in the large samples occurs at lower stresses.",0
"Introduction Le lichen plan pemphigoÃ¯de (LPP) est une affection rare, parfois dâorigine mÃ©dicamenteuse, qui mÃªle les caractÃ©ristiques cliniques, histologiques et immunologiques des deux affections. Nous rapportons le premier cas de LPP Ã topographie exclusivement gÃ©nitale survenu lors dâun traitement par nivolumab dans le cadre dâun mÃ©lanome mÃ©tastatique (MM). Observations Un patient de 77 ans, traitÃ© en seconde ligne pour un MM par nivolumab 3mg/kg/cure IV tous les 15jours avec une bonne efficacitÃ© clinique, voyait apparaÃ®tre aprÃ¨s la 8e perfusion (S15) une ulcÃ©ration gÃ©nitale indolore de 2cm de diamÃ¨tre de la couronne du gland. Les sÃ©rologies HSV, syphilis ainsi que les prÃ©lÃ¨vements bactÃ©riologiques et virologiques Ã©taient non contributifs. Lâhistologie montrait un aspect compatible avec un LP Ã©rosif mais avec prÃ©sence de dÃ©pÃ´ts immuns linÃ©aires dâIgG et de C3Â le long de la basale permettant de porter le diagnostic de LPP gÃ©nital (LPPG) probablement induit par le nivolumab. Des anticorps circulants antimembrane basale Ã©taient dÃ©tectÃ©s par IFI et lâimmunoblot identifiait une protÃ©ine de 180kDa compatible avec un BPAG2. AprÃ¨s traitement local par propionate de clobÃ©tasol puis tacrolimus topique partiellement efficaces et mal tolÃ©rÃ©s, une corticothÃ©rapie gÃ©nÃ©rale par prednisone Ã 0,5mg/kg/j permettait une cicatrisation gÃ©nitale aprÃ¨s 1mois tandis que le nivolumab Ã©tait poursuivi en raison de son efficacitÃ©. LâulcÃ©ration gÃ©nitale rÃ©cidivait toutefois Ã lâarrÃªt de la corticothÃ©rapie imposant un traitement dâentretien Ã 10mg/j. Devant une rÃ©mission complÃ¨te de la maladie mÃ©tastatique depuis 12Â mois, le nivolumab Ã©tait interrompu aprÃ¨s la 30e perfusion. Six semaines aprÃ¨s celle-ci, les lÃ©sions de LPP Ã©taient contrÃ´lÃ©es mais avec une corticodÃ©pendance Ã 10mg/j de prednisone (Fig. 1). Discussion Il sâagit de la premiÃ¨re observation de LPPG survenant au cours dâun traitement par nivolumab pour un MM, Ã rapprocher dâun cas de LPP du tronc et des extrÃ©mitÃ©s apparu sous pembrolizumab, mais aussi de 2Â cas de lichen plan muqueux et de 2Â cas de pemphigoÃ¯de bulleuse associÃ©s Ã lâemploi dâanti-PD1. MÃªme si cette affection Â«Â frontiÃ¨reÂ Â» survient en gÃ©nÃ©ral sans facteur dÃ©clenchant individualisÃ©, certains cas sont probablement liÃ©s Ã une prise mÃ©dicamenteuse (IEC, statinesâ¦) dont dâautres immunothÃ©rapies (interfÃ©ron/ribavirine) ou encore paranÃ©oplasiques. Les effets secondaires cutanÃ©s des anti-PD1Â sont parmi les plus frÃ©quentsÂ et souvent de nature dysimmunitaire (rash, vitiligoâ¦) et lâapparition dâune maladie bulleuse auto-immune Â«Â classiqueÂ Â» ou de type LPP fait probablement Ã©galement partie du spectre des effets indÃ©sirables immunologiques de cette classe de molÃ©cules. Conclusion Il nây a pas de traitement codifiÃ© Ã ce jour de cette complication auto-immune qui apparaÃ®t de prise en charge dÃ©licate probablement en raison dâune stimulation immunitaire prolongÃ©e.",0
"The as-cast and heat-treated microstructures and mechanical properties of the AZ91 magnesium alloys with and without minor Sc addition were investigated and compared in this paper. The results indicated that adding 0.15â0.45â¯wt% Sc to the as-cast AZ91 alloy not only could modify and refine the Mg17Al12 phase but also suppress the formation of the Mg17Al12 phase. At the same time, the grains of the Sc-containing as-cast AZ91 alloys were also effectively refined. As a result, the mechanical properties at room temperature (RT) for the Sc-containing as-cast AZ91 alloys were effectively improved. In addition, adding 0.15â0.45â¯wt%Sc to the AZ91 alloy promoted the formation of the continuous precipitates (CP) during the aging treatment in spite of that the formation of the discontinuous precipitates (DP) was simultaneously suppressed. Accordingly, the Sc-containing as-aged AZ91 alloys obtained the relatively higher mechanical properties at RT than the as-aged AZ91 alloy.",0
"The field dependence (up to 35 T) at 4.2 K of the magnetization of several compounds of the type R1âx Y x Fe2 was studied. The magnetic isotherms at 4.2 K were analyzed with a mean-field model. The magnetic coupling constant J FRe between the moments of the rare earth (R) and Fe in the Hamiltonian H = Î£ RFe2J RFe S R S Fe were compared with the coupling constants derived from a mean-field analysis of the Curie temperatures. From a comparison of the magnetic coupling constants found by means of high-field measurements in the compounds RFe2, RFe3, R6Fe23 and R2Fe17 it follows that the R-Fe coupling constants have a pronounced tendency to decrease with Fe concentration.",0
"The aim of this study was to compare the fracture resistance and failure pattern of endodontically treated maxillary incisors restored using composite resin with or without fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) posts under different types of full-coverage crowns. The null hypothesis tested was that fracture resistance and the failure pattern of these teeth were not affected by the use of FRC posts or by the type of full-coverage crown. One hundred twenty maxillary incisors were endodontically treated and divided into 4 groups of 30 each. Each group was divided into two subgroups: restoration with or without fiber post. PFM crowns were placed in group 1, Empress II crowns in group 2, SR Adoro crowns in group 3, and Cercon crowns in group 4. Fracture tests were performed by loading specimens to fracture. Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (Î± = 0.05). The type of crown was not a significant factor affecting fracture resistance (p = 0.4), whereas the presence of a post was (p = 0.001). Both the presence of post and the type of crown had a significant influence on the proportion of restorable versus unrestorable fractures. Although prosthodontics textbooks do not generally advocate the placement of fiber posts in endodontically treated incisors, the results of this study indicate that the use of fiber posts in such teeth increases their resistance to fracture and improves the prognosis in case of fracture.",0
"Emission intensity variation of the leading 542 nm emission line of Tb3+ centre in NaâGd phosphate glasses under 308 nm excimer laser line irradiation was studied. Furthermore, induced optical absorption measurements after 308 nm laser, X-ray and Î³-ray irradiations were performed. Thermoluminescence (TSL) above room temperature was also studied after 308 nm and X-ray irradiations at 295 K. The observed phenomenology evidences the presence of traps, which compete for carrier capture from the Gd3+ energy guiding sublattice with Tb3+ emission centres. The radiation induced optical absorption features are explained as due to both Tb4+ and host lattice-related hole colour centres.",1
"Nanocrystalline Ni powders were successfully fabricated by mechanically milling at cryogenic temperature (cryomilling) with 1 wt.%Y2O3 particles. The experimental results have shown that the Ni grain size is reduced to 25 nm after 2 h of cryomilling in the presence of the Y2O3 particles. The cryomilled Ni/Y2O3 powders can maintain their nanocrystalline structure up to 900Â°C, or 62% of the melting point of Ni. A bulk nanocrystalline Ni/Y2O3 material with a thermally stable grain size of approximately 100 nm was produced by cryomilling, cold isostatic pressing, followed by hot isostatic pressing. The microhardness of bulk nanocrystalline Ni/1wt.%Y2O3 is 315 DPH, which is two times as high as that of conventional Ni.",0
"A woven glass-fibre-reinforced composite with a polyamide 6,6 matrix is considered for the purpose of being integrated into an automotive part. Fatigue tests were conducted on both [(0/90)3] and [(Â±45)3] stacking sequences. In order to analyze the influence of moisture content on the fatigue behaviour, samples were conditioned at RH0, RH50 and RH100. Although moisture content affects the fatigue life for high stress levels, this effect tends to disappear for low stress levels. This phenomenon was confirmed by additional fatigue tests in a climatic chamber. This paper aims to investigate damage mechanisms developing within the material during fatigue test in order to understand the origin of this phenomenon. Two in-situ non-destructive techniques were used in order to detail the fatigue damage scenario: namely, acoustic emission and infrared thermography. These techniques allow locating and differentiating the main damage mechanisms: matrix cracking, fibre/matrix debonding and fibre breakages. In addition, microscopic observations and synchrotron X-ray microtomography were realized on fatigue coupons to visualize fibre breakages. Results have highlighted an increase in the amount of fibre breakage when the applied fatigue stress decreases, which explains the observed phenomenon.",0
"The effect of Mg content (2.5 and 7.5Â wt%) on the development of centrifugally cast in-situ A356-Mg2Si composite functionally graded material (FGM) has been investigated. The secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) has the effect on size and volume% of Mg2Si particles. FGMs are characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, measurement of hardness and room and elevated temperature tensile properties (UTS). The microstructural features are correlated with room temperature and high temperature tensile properties at 150Â Â°C and 300Â Â°C. Since the population of Mg2Si particles are maximum at inner zones, the tensile strengths at these zones are maximum among the three zones. The room temperature tensile strength of FGM with 7.5Â wt% Mg shows maximum value however it decreases at higher temperatures. The peak UTS of both FG composites in all three zones are attained at around 150Â Â°C. Maximum peak UTS of 178Â MPa is obtained with A356â2.5%Mg at this temperature. As the test temperature is increased, the fracture mode is changed from mixed mode to ductile mode. Particle cracking and decohesion of particles from the softer matrix are responsible for these two modes respectively.",0

"We report results of dc magnetization and specific heat studies focusing on the paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition in GdCu6. These results clearly reveal the evidences of multiple magnetic transitions in GdCu6. In addition, a marked thermomagnetic irreversibility is observed in the temperature dependence of magnetization in low ( < 10 kOe ) applied magnetic fields. Nature of the magnetic response changes with the increase in applied magnetic field in the temperature regime around the paramagneticâantiferromagnetic transition temperature and also well inside the antiferromagnetic state. Experimentally measured specific heat in GdCu6 is quite large in the temperature regime below 20K, which indicates to the potential of GdCu6 as a magnetic regenerator material for cryocooler related applications. Isothermal magnetic entropy change estimated from the results of magnetization and specific heat measurements shows a change in sign at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature.",0
"In this paper, the mechanical properties and failure modes of 3D printed fiber-reinforced polyamide 12 (PA12) composite lattice structures were studied using digital image correlation (DIC). First, the fiber-reinforced PA12 composite tensile samples and lattice structures were prepared by selective laser sintering (SLS). Then the tensile experiments were carried out on the tensile samples, and the tensile strength and elastic modulus were obtained. Moreover, the compressive experiments were carried out on the 3D printed PA12 composite lattice structures. The full field displacements and strains were obtained using DIC, and the failure position and failure mode can be captured from the strain fields. The repetitive energy absorption property of the lattice structures was comparative analyzed between the 3D printed PA12 composite lattice structures with and without fiber-reinforcements. The experimental results show that the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the 3D printed PA12 composites with fiber-reinforcements are higher than that without fiber-reinforcements. The compressive strength of the 3D printed PA12 composite lattice structures with fiber-reinforcements are lower than that without fiber-reinforcements, but the repetitive energy absorption property of the 3D printed PA12 composites lattice structures with fiber-reinforcements are more stable than that without fiber-reinforcements.",0
"The near/mid-infrared emission of Er3+-doped, Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped and Er3+-Mn2+-Yb3+ tri-doped in 40SiO2â(22.9-x)Al2O3â20BaF2â10LaF3â5TiO2â xMnOâ0.1Er2O3â2Yb2O3 (in mol.%, xâ¯=â¯0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 10.0) (acronym: SGC-xMn) transparent silicate glass-ceramics were prepared. Enhanced near/mid-infrared emission intensity of Er3+-doped bands centered at â¼1.54 and â¼2.73â¯Âµm in transparent silicate glass-ceramics via Mn2+âYb3+ dimer under 980â¯nm excitation were investigated. XRD results indicate that the Mn2+ ions are dispersed into the glass matrix. With the forming of Mn2+âYb3+ dimer and the energy transfer processes from Mn2+âYb3+ dimer and Mn2+ to Er3+ ions has led to NIR emission intensity of Er3+-doped at â¼1.54â¯Âµm was increased significantly about four-fold and the MIR emission intensity of Er3+-doped at â¼2.73â¯Âµm was increased about third-fold. In addition, based on the decay time spectra, mechanism of energy transfer processes between Mn2+âYb3+ dimer, Mn2+ and Er3+ ions were also discussed.",1
"A novel hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor has been fabricated by electrodepositing silver on glassy carbon electrode modified with layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the introduction of LDH substrate can enhance the electrocatalytic performance toward H2O2 of the sensor. Morphology characterization indicates that dendritic Ag nanostructure is present on the obtained electrodes by using LDHs as substrate. The growth mechanism of Ag nanodendrites is discussed using diffusion-limited aggregation model. After optimization of experimental conditions, a H2O2 sensor with a wide linear range (10Î¼M to 19.33mM) and a low detection limit (2.2Î¼M) has been obtained. In addition, this sensor also exhibits good selectivity and reproducibility. This novel hierarchical structured sensor broadens the application of LDHs in electrochemical fields and provides a simple and feasible approach to meet the advanced application demand for H2O2 detection.",0
"Effect of fluoride ions introduction on structural, OHâ content and up-conversion luminescence properties in Er3+-doped heavy metal oxide glasses have been investigated. Structure was investigated, indicating that fluoride has an important influence on the phonon density, maximum phonon energy of host glasses. With increasing fluoride content, the up-conversion luminescence intensity and quantum efficiencies increase notably, which could not be explained only by the maximum phonon energy change of host glasses. Our results show that, with the introduction of PbF2, the decrease of phonon density and OHâ content contributes more to the enhanced up-conversion emissions than that of maximum phonon energy.",1
"By studying temperature dependence of specific heat C p of copolymers by dynamic calorimetry results were obtained concerning glass transition, melting and crystallization of Ï-dodecane lactam (DL) and Ïµ-caprolactam (CL). It was concluded that the addition of a second component to the homopolymer produces a uniform change in parameters of glass transition, melting and crystallization, the most considerable changes being observed for copolymers of composition, DL+CL=50Â±20%.",0
"Thermally conductive glass fibers cloth/spherical boron nitride fillers/epoxy (GFs/BN/epoxy) laminated composites with excellent electrical insulation properties were fabricated by blending-impregnation followed by hot compression method. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was successfully grafted onto the surface of GFs (f-GFs), in favor of improving the mechanical properties of the f-GFs/epoxy laminated composites. For a given spherical BN fillers loading, GBN-100 with relatively larger particle size was more benefit for enhancing the thermal conductivities of the BN/epoxy composites. Meantime, thermal conductivity coefficient (Î») values of the f-GFs/GBN-100/epoxy laminated composites were gradually enhanced with the increasing addition of GBN-100 fillers. When the mass fraction of GBN-100 fillers was 20â¯wt%, the Î» in vertical (Î» â¥) and parallel (Î» â¥) of the f-GFs/GBN-100/epoxy laminated composites was the maximum of 1.21 and 3.55â¯Wâ¯mâ1Kâ1, about 3 and 6 times than that of the f-GFs/epoxy laminated composites (Î» â¥ of 0.41â¯Wâ¯mâ1Kâ1 and Î» â¥ of 0.66â¯Wâ¯mâ1Kâ1), respectively, and much higher than that of pure epoxy matrix (0.23â¯Wâ¯mâ1Kâ1). Meantime, the surface resistivity and breakdown strength of the f-GFs/GBN-100/epoxy laminated composites with 20Â wt% GBN-100 fillers was respectively decreased to 5.1*1014â¯Î© and 7â¯KVâ¯mmâ1, but still maintained excellent electrical insulation properties.",0
"The crystallization kinetics of a glass with a molar composition 40BaOâ20ZnOâ30B2O3â10SiO2 was investigated. The kinetic parameters, activation energy for crystallization (Ec ) and Avrami exponent (n), were evaluated under non-isothermal conditions using the results obtained by differential thermal analysis (DTA) performed at different heating rates. DTA curves exhibited two overlapping exothermic peaks associated with the crystallization of the glass. Barium borate (BaB4O7) was the first crystalline phase to be formed and it was followed by the formation of barium zinc silicate (BaZnSiO4), as identified by XRD. For the first exothermic peak, when the fraction of crystallization (Ï) increased from 0.1 to 0.9, the local activation energy (Ec (Ï)) decreased from 700 to 500kJ/mol, while for the second exothermic peak, Ec (Ï) slightly increased from 490 to 570kJ/mol. For the range of 0.1< Ï <0.9, the local Avrami exponent (n(Ï)) increased from â¼1 to 1.4 for the first exothermic peak and it decreased from â¼1.7 to 1.4 for the second exothermic peak. Observation by SEM of the microstructure of sintered glass samples revealed that crystallization started at the surface of glass particles, with growth of lamellar crystallites, that together with some quasi-spherical nano-sized crystallites progressed towards the inside of the glass at the highest sintering temperatures. The change of the local activation energy with the fraction of crystallization suggested that a multi-step kinetic reaction took place during sintering and crystallization of the glass.",1
"The effects of conducting glasses on photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) using nanocrystalline TiO2 were studied. The indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate showed low ability to withstand heat treatment during the annealing process, leading to an increase in sheet resistance. The heat stability of ITO conducting glass was greatly improved by depositing metal oxide, such as antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO), aluminium-doped zinc oxide, and SnO2, on the ITO layer. The cell made from mesoporous-assembled TiO2 nanocrystal (MP-TiO2) showed the higher cell efficiency (6.5%) than that made from commercially available P25 TiO2 powders (5.6%). A high short-circuit current of MP-TiO2 cell (13.2Â mA/cm2) could be due to pure anatase phase content and high surface area of the mesoporous-assembled TiO2 nanocrystal. The addition of commercially available TiO2 powders in MP-TiO2 improved the cell efficiency (7.2%) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra of the cell due to the increase in the light scattering ability of the agglomerated particles of commercially available TiO2. The efficiency of cells using double-layered ITO/ATO and ITO/SnO2 substrates was higher than that of the cells using single-layered ITO substrate. Among various conducting glasses, the cell made from ITO/SnO2 showed the highest efficiency. The heat stability of ITO substrate can be improved by increasing the film thickness of SnO2, with SnO2 layer thickness of 100Â nm exhibiting the highest cell efficiency in this study (7.2%). The double-layered ITO/SnO2 was proved to be a superior substrate for using in DSCs.",0
"Previous studies have reported the existence of a photoluminescence (PL) band in silica glass that originates from oxygen molecules (PL peak: â¼0.97 eV, full width at half maximum (FWHM): â¼10 meV, decay time (Ï): â©¾100 ms) and ozone (PL peak: â¼1.9 eV, FWHM: â¼0.12 eV, Ï: uncertain) following irradiation by F2 laser (7.9 eV), Î³-rays, and neutrons. In this paper, we report the PL properties produced by high-temperature (1200â1500 Â°C) oxygen processing carried out on silica glass in air. The red PL band (peak: â¼1.85 eV, FWHM: â¼0.33 eV, Ï: â¼5 ms) was observed for the case of high-temperature oxygen processing. Our studies indicate that the oxygen processing is closely related to the generation of the 1.85 eV PL.",1
"Nuclear spin resonance has been used to study the deuteron magnetization recovery in (KI)0.5(ND4I)0.5 mixed crystals. At high temperatures the spin-lattice-relaxation is exponential. For T âª 45 K deviations from this simple behaviour occur, signalling the onset of spatial inhomogeneities due to the formation of an orientational glass. The results demonstrate that the transition of (KI)0.5(ND4I)0.5 into the glassy state is driven by the freezing of random bonds.",0
"Superionic conducting phase of Î±-AgI, which is thermodynamically stable only above 147Â°C, was successfully frozen at ambient temperature in various kinds of glass matrices in the systems AgIî¸Ag2Oî¸MxOy (MxOy=B2O3, GeO2,P2O5 and MoO3) by a rapid quenching technique. The larger composition regions where Î±-AgI was frozen were observed in the systems with B2O3 and GeO2 than in the systems with P2O5 and MoO3. Since the glasses with B2O3 and GeO2 have higher glass transition temperature than those with P2O5 and MoO3, the former glasses have higher viscosities at 147Â° C. The former matrix glasses have stronger effect to depress the Î±-Î² transformation of AgI rather than the latter glasses in the course of rapid quenching of melts.",0

"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of various wood preservative systems and treatment processes (pre- and post-treatment) on wood/FRP composite adhesive bond durability and shear strength. The effects of common wood preservative treatments on the durability of wood and E-glass/phenolic pultruded sheet interfaces and wood/wood interfaces was studied through a standard accelerated cyclic exposure test method. Pre-treatment of individual wood laminations with oil-borne (copper naphthanate, pentachlorophenol and creosote) and water-borne (CCA and CDDC) preservatives increased the delamination between the wood and FRP composite reinforcement with respect to untreated control samples. Post-treatments of wood/FRP composite laminated beams with the same preservative systems had more limited effects than pre-treatments on delamination. In most cases, for both pre and post treatment the wood/FRP delamination was beyond the limit allowed for wood-wood gluelines by the standard. Compatible preservative systems for use with E-glass/phenolic composite reinforcement in pre- and post-treatment applications, which are appropriate for the preservative/pressure treatment used by the wood-lamination industry, were identified. Preservative treatment recommendations were developed.",0
Pressure effect on the Curie temperature T c of NdMn2Ge2 and PrMn2Ge2 have been measured in order to study the atomic distance dependence of the Mn-Mn interaction for RMn2Ge2 (R: a rare earth metal). The values of dT c/dp are found to be â0.6 K/kbar for NdMn2Ge2 and â0.2 K/kbar for PrMn2Ge2.,0
"Excessive consumption of electrical energy has hampered the widespread application of electrochemical technology for degradation of various contaminants. In this paper, a Fe-based metallic glass (MG) was demonstrated as a new type of electrocatalyst to effectively and economically degrade an azo dye. In comparison to other typical electrodes, Fe-based MG electrodes exhibit a minimized degradation time, and the specific energy is 4â6 orders of magnitude lower than that of dimensionally stable anode (DSA), metal-like boron-doped diamond (BDD) and other electrodes. As sacrificial electrode materials, Fe-based MGs have less specific electrode mass consumption than iron electrodes. The use of Fe-based MGs will promote the practical application of electrochemical technology and the use of MGs as functional materials.",0
"Nd3+-doped P2O5âAl2O3âK2OâBaO (LHG-8) glasses were prepared and the internal quantum efficiency (QE) of near-infrared emission of the glasses were directly measured with a simulated sunlight source and an 800nm laser. The stimulated emission cross section (Ï) and the radiative emission lifetime (Ïr ) were also obtained by JuddâOfelt analysis. The QE of Nd3+:LHG-8 under the simulated sunlight was as high as 60% at the Nd2O3 concentration of 0.05mol%, and this value was higher than those of Nd3+-doped oxide glasses, such as borosilicate, silicate, and tellurite glasses. The ÏÏr of LHG-8 was also higher than those of the other Nd3+-doped oxide glasses.",1
"Rhombohedral structural Ca3CoMnO6 was prepared. The microstructure, chemical composition, morphology were checked and the magnetic properties were investigated in detail. Due to the âorder-by-disorderâ phenomenon, the ZFC curve presents negative susceptibility in low temperature region. Besides the antiferromagnetic transition around TNâ¯=â¯13.5â¯K, another abnormal peak around T f â¯=â¯172â¯K was also observed. The shift of the abnormal peak towards low temperature with the field increases, magnetic relaxation experiment and the training effect confirm the freezing spin glass characteristic. The broadening of the freezing peak in higher field can be well explained by the reduction of short-range magnetic correlation length. Due to the competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions, obvious exchange bias effect was observed.",0
"Understanding the influence of rare earth ions in improving the optical properties of glasses are important in order to extend in advanced application. The behavior of series of Er3+ (1.0â2.0â¯mol %) doped B2O3-TeO2-MgO-Na2O glasses synthesized by conventional melt-quenching technique are explored. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirms the amorphous nature of the prepared glass sample. The DTA data asserts that the addition of Er3+ increased the thermal stability from 142 to 207â¯Â°C. The UVâVISâNIR spectra reveal ten absorption bands centered at 4G11/2, 2H9/2, 4F5/2, 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2, 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 from ground state of 4I15/2. The JuddâOfelt Î©2 parameter values gradually decreases with the increase of erbium ions concentration from 0.5 to 2â¯mol %. From the JuddâOfelt parameters (Î©t), transition probabilities (A), branching ratios (Î²R) of various transitions and their radiative lifetimes (Ïrad) are calculated. The up-conversion emission spectra of Er3+ exhibit four peaks centered at 538â¯nm, 554â¯nm, 653â¯nm and 822â¯nm assigned to 2H11/2â¯ââ¯4I15/2, 4S3/2â¯ââ¯4I15/2, 4F9/2â¯ââ¯4I15/2 and 4I9/2â¯ââ¯4I15/2 transitions respectively in all samples. The maximum enhancement is evidenced at 1.5â¯mol% of Er2O3 by a factor of 3.11, 1.88 and 2.80 times for 2H11/2â¯ââ¯4I15/2, 4S3/2â¯ââ¯4I15/2 and 4I9/2â¯ââ¯4I15/2 transitions respectively. A schematic energy level diagram is proposed. The effective band width at half maximum (FWHM) (ÎÎ»eff), stimulated emission cross-section ( Î´ P E ) and the product of Î´ P E Ã F W H M for 4S3/2 transitions of the glasses have also been studied and reported.",1
"Manganeseânoble metal alloys exhibit a large variety of magnetic structures as a function of Mn concentration. Ab initio studies of these structures are practically absent due to difficulties in handling simultaneously atomic and magnetic ordering effects in disordered alloys. In this work we use the generalized perturbation method (GPM) A.V.Ruban, S. Shallcross, S.I. Simak H.L. Skriver, Phys. Rev. B 70 (2004) 125115 in the framework of the KKR method and the coherent potential approximation (CPA) in order to determine both effective chemical interactions and magnetic exchange interaction parameters of the classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian in CuâMn alloys. The effective chemical interactions have been used in Ising Monte Carlo simulations to determine the equilibrium distribution of atoms on the FCC lattice at the experimental aging temperatures. The obtained atomic short-range order for CuâMn alloys is in excellent agreement with the existing experimental data. The underlying atomic distribution has subsequently been used in Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations with the exchange interaction parameters calculated for the corresponding alloy composition by the GPM method. For alloys with low Mn content, up to 20at%, we find a transition into a spin-glass state with a specific magnetic short order.",0
"In this work, we present an easy and low-cost technique for the fabrication of poly(pyrrole) (PPy) micro structures onto glass and poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PET) substrates by combining microcontact printing (Î¼CP) and electroless polymerization. The substrates: glass and PET were activated in piranha and potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, respectively. The activated substrates were then functionalized with 11-(triethoxysilyl)undecanal (TESUD) using structured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps and transferred by Î¼CP. After printing, the PPy was grown onto the silane patterned surface using electroless polymerization. The printed patterns were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results have shown that PPy rings can be developed and were well-defined onto glass and PET substrates through Î¼CP and electroless polymerization. The PPy was grown to dimensions of an inner ring diameter (IRD) of 50, 30 and 20Î¼m and an outer ring diameter (ORD) of 30, 20 and 10Î¼m, respectively. The estimated thickness of PPy structures was measured at 2.8Â±0.4Î¼m by AFM. This innovating technique represents a first step in the production of a PPy printed matrix for potential flexible biosensors.",0
"The femtosecond laser was used to irradiate solâgel derived Sm3+-doped Al2O3âSiO2 glasses, in which the Sm3+ was reduced into Sm2+ ions. The fluorescence line narrowing was applied to investigate the coordination sphere of the Sm2+ ion. The spectral hole burning was performed on 7F0â5D0 transition of the Sm2+. The depth and width of the burnt holes were â¼27% and â¼4cmâ1 FWHM at 7K, respectively. Hole spectra were stable up to room temperature. The hole-burning efficiency was superior to that of Sm2+ in H2 treated glasses and comparable to that in X-ray in terms of hole-burning dynamics.",1

Neutron scattering experiments on the amorphous spin glass Al2Mn3Si3O12 with energy resolutions from 0.5â0.0006 meV reveal an exponential dependence of the relaxation time on reciprocal temperature. This study of the quasi-elastic intensity as a function of temperature points to the possibility that the spin glass behaviour in this compound is due to a relaxation phenomenon. In this paper we report on results obtained with high resolution triple-axis and backscattering neutron spectrometers.,0
"In this paper we present conductivity spectra of the ion conducting glasses B2O3 Â· 0.56Li2O Â· 0.45LiBr and Ag2S Â· GeS2 and of the polaron conducting glass 0.2P2O5 Â· 0.8 (0.89V2O5 Â· 0.11V2O4), covering a frequency range of more than 13 decades. At frequencies below the onset of the vibrational motion the spectra of both ion conducting glasses clearly differ from those of the polaronic glass. The dispersive conductivity of 0.2P2O5 Â· 0.8 (0.89V2O5 Â· 0.11V2O4) follows a simple power-law behavior, the exponent being smaller than one. In contrast, the conductivities of both ion conducting glasses show the existence of two power-law exponents; one is the Jonscher exponent, the other is larger than unity. The data are interpreted in terms of the âunified site relaxation modelâ.",0
"This work is devoted to the electrical properties investigation of composite materials AgGe1+x As1âx (S+CNT)3(x =0.4;0.5;0.6) containing carbon nanotubes in the temperature interval from 10 to 300K in the frequency range of AC from 1Hz to 27MHz. The aim of this paper was to establish temperature ranges corresponding to beginning of appreciable ion transport in AgGe1+x As1âx (S+CNT)3(x =0.4;0.5;0.6) composite materials, as well as to features identify in the electrical properties behavior in the temperature range from 10 to 300K. It found that the temperatures corresponding to the beginning of appreciable ion transport in these materials belong to the temperature interval from 170 to 220K. Moreover, during the study three temperature- and frequency-dependent conductivity regimes were established: (1) NCL regime observed at low temperatures, conductivity is weakly dependent on temperature in this region; (2) Jonscher type region and (3) dc region in which a temperature dependence of the conductivity of the activation type. The presence of three temperature regimes is also observed on the dependencies of the real parts of the impedance versus temperature.",0
Yb3+/Er3+ codoped fluorophosphate glass has been investigated for developing broadband waveguide amplifier application. Spectroscopic properties and energy transfer microparameters of prepared glasses have been discussed. The spectral components of 1.55Î¼m emission are analyzed and an equivalent four-level system is proposed to estimate the stark splitting for the 4I15/2 and 4I13/2 levels in Er3+ doped fluorophosphate glass. The results indicate that highly doped Yb3+ ions could transfer energy to Er ions efficiently in fluorophosphate glass and Er3+/Yb3+ doped fluorophosphate glass is preferable for broadband Er3+-doped waveguide amplifier application.,1
"Based on the Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 bulk-metallic glass (BMG), the Cu47.5Zr38Hf9.5Al5 BMG composite with a CuZr phase is fabricated successfully. The four-point-bend fatigue behaviors are investigated. The fatigue-endurance limit of the BMG composite is 378MPa, based on the stress range (Ï r = Ï max â Ï min, where Ï max and Ï min are the applied maximum and minimum stresses, respectively). This value is much higher than that (224MPa) of the BMG. The fatigue ratios (=the maximum stress range/yield strength corresponding to the fatigue cycles equal to 107) of the BMG composite and the BMG are 0.23 and 0.12, respectively. The different fatigue-fracture surfaces of the BMG and BMG composite show somewhat different fracture mechanisms, which could be rationalized in terms of the effects of the second phase in the composite.",0
"Langasite-type crystals such as Ba3Ga2Ge4O14 and BaGa4La2Ge2O14 are formed through the crystallization of gallium germanate glasses with stoichiometric compositions corresponding to langasite-type phases and optical properties of crystallized glasses are clarified. It is found that the single langasite-type phase is easily formed in each corresponding glass. The crystallized glasses with highly oriented langasite-type crystals at the surface are fabricated using an ultrasonic surface treatment method. The crystallized glasses with Ba x Ga5âx La3âx Ge1+x O14 phases show moderate second harmonic (SH) intensities of 5â75 times as large as Î±-quartz, and it is found that the SH intensity of Ba x Ga5âx La3âx Ge1+x O14 phases increases with the increase of the La3+/Ba2+ ratio. The feature of fluorescence spectra of Eu3+ ions incorporated into langasite-type crystals is also discussed.",1
"A C/SiC oxidation resistance coating was prepared on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by slurry and pack cementation. The microstructure, oxidation resistance and mechanical properties of C/SiC coating prepared from 1773 to 2573K were investigated. With the increase of the preparation temperature, the oxidation resistance of C/SiC coating increases, however, the flexure strength decreases gradually. The preparation of C/SiC coating on C/C composites results in the fracture behavior of C/C composites changing from pseudo-plastic to brittle failure model. The decrease of flexure strength is mainly attributed to the decrease of C/C matrixâ flexure strength at high temperature.",0
Chalcogenide glasses are interesting materials due to their infrared transmitting properties and photo-induced effects exhibited by them. Thin films of the glasses Sn10Sb20â x Bi x Se70 (0â©½ x â©½8) prepared by melt quenching technique were evaporated in a vacuum better than 10â5 mbar. Optical transmission spectra of all the deposited films were obtained in a range 400â2500nm. The optical band gap and the absorption coefficient were calculated from the transmission data and refractive index was calculated using the swanepoel method. The optical band gap initially increases with increase in Bi content (for x =2) and then decreases sharply for higher Bi concentrations. The refractive index as well as absorption coefficient decrease with increase in wavelength. The dark activation energy initially increases with increase in Bi content and then decreases with further addition.,1
"Local structure and luminescent properties of lead phosphate glasses containing rare earth ions were studied. Optically active ions such as Eu3+, Dy3+, Tb3+ and Er3+ were chosen as dopants. The local structure was verified using X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The visible luminescence bands recorded for the studied samples corresponded to 5D0â7F J (J=0Ã·4) transitions of Eu3+, 4F9/2â6H J/2 (J=11Ã·15) transitions of Dy3+, 5D3â7F J' (J'=1Ã·6) and 5D4â7F J (J=3Ã·6) transitions of Tb3+, and 4S3/2â4I15/2 transitions of Er3+.",1
"Objective A major limiting factor for the widespread use of zirconia in prosthetic dentistry is its poor resin-cement bonding capabilities. We show that this deficiency can be overcome by infiltrating the zirconia cementation surface with glass. Current methods for assessing the fracture resistance of resin-ceramic bonds are marred by uneven stress distribution at the interface, which may result in erroneous interfacial fracture resistance values. We have applied a wedge-loaded double-cantilever-beam testing approach to accurately measure the interfacial fracture resistance of adhesively bonded zirconia-based restorative materials. Methods The interfacial fracture energy G C was determined for adhesively bonded zirconia, graded zirconia and feldspathic ceramic bars. The bonding surfaces were subjected to sandblasting or acid etching treatments. Baseline G C was measured for bonded specimens subjected to 7 days hydration at 37Â°C. Long-term G C was determined for specimens exposed to 20,000 thermal cycles between 5 and 55Â°C followed by 2-month aging at 37Â°C in water. The test data were interpreted with the aid of a 2D finite element fracture analysis. Results The baseline and long-term G C for graded zirconia was 2â3 and 8 times greater than that for zirconia, respectively. More significantly, both the baseline and long-term G C of graded zirconia were similar to those for feldspathic ceramic. Significance The interfacial fracture energy of feldspathic ceramic and graded zirconia was controlled by the fracture energy of the resin cement while that of zirconia by the interface. G C for the graded zirconia was as large as for feldspathic ceramic, making it an attractive material for use in dentistry.",0
"Effect of magnetic fields on phase transitions in the exchange competing system Fe x Mn1âx TiO3 with x = 0.60, 0.65 and 0.75, which exhibit the reentrant spin-glass transition from the antiferromagnetic state in weak fields, has been investigated by measuring the magnetization process in pulsed magnetic fields. The spin-flip-like transition (metamagnetic transition) is observed at 4.2 K for each sample. The critical field of the transition decreases monotonically with the increase of temperature and this transition vanishes above the NÃ©el temperature. The field variations of the reentrant spin-glass transition and NÃ©el temperatures have been also observed. From these observations the field-temperature phase diagram is determined for each of these reentrant spin-glass samples. The shape of the phase diagram is qualitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction given for Ising systems exhibiting the reentrant transition from the antiferromagnetic state.",0
"A new series of emission-tunable alkali fluoroborate glasses with molar composition (70-x-y)B2O3 + 10BaO + 10K2O + 10ZnF2 + xEu2O3 + yTb4O7 (y = 0.0, 1.0mol% and x as 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0mol%) were prepared using the conventional melt quenching technique. The photoluminescence characteristics of the prepared glasses were explored and the efficient energy transfer between Tb3+ ions and Eu3+ ions under 484nm excitation was confirmed using excitation and emission spectra. The photoluminescence and lifetime measurements reveal the efficient energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ through quadrupoleâquadrupole interaction between the rare earth ions. The important energy transfer parameters such as energy transfer probability and transfer efficiency were computed. The energy transfer efficiency was considerably increased with an increase in the concentration of Eu3+ ions. The CIE chromaticity analysis revealed that the as obtained glassy system exhibits a greenish-orange emission with a low concentration of Eu3+ ions and can be tuned to orange-red emission by increasing the concentration of Eu3+ ions. The obtained results suggest that the prepared glassy system has potential applications in various optoelectronic devices.",1
"A series of Ce-, Dy-, and Eu doped oxyfluoride aluminoborosilicate glasses prepared by melt-quenching method are studied for light emitting diodes applications. These glasses are investigated via optical absorption, photoluminescence, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectra, Commission International de IâEclairage (CIE) color coordinates, and correlated color temperatures (CCTs). We find that the emission bands of Ce3+ ions move to the longer wavelengths with increasing excitation wavelengths and the molar ratio of B2O3/SiO2, Al2O3/SiO2, and B2O3/Al2O3 in the glass compositions. The precipitation of CaF2 crystals in glass can also lead to the red shift of the emission of Ce3+. The energy transfer processes among Ce3+, Dy3+, Eu3+, and Eu2+ ions are also investigated. The influence of the variation of glass network structure on the luminescence of Ce/Dy/Eu codoped glasses is studied. The CIE color coordinates and CCTs could be effectively tuned by adjusting the glass matrix compositions and excitation wavelengths. Furthermore, the near-ideal white light emission (color coordinate x=0.32, y=0.31) from the Ce/Dy/Eu codoped glass under near ultraviolet (UV) light excitation is realized.",1
"In this paper, large-scale, single-crystalline ZnO nanotube arrays were directly fabricated onto F-doped SnO2 (TCO) glass substrate via an electrochemical deposition method from an aqueous solution for the first time. The tubes had a preferential orientation along the [0001] direction and hexagon-shaped cross sections. The novel nanostructure could be easily fabricated without a prepared layer of seeds on the substrate. The surface condition of substrate material and the experimental conditions played a key role in the nanotube formation. A possible formation mechanism has been proposed.",0
"In this work, high-intensity ultrasonic vibration was employed in in-situ casting of aluminum matrix composites. In-situ Al3Ti/2024 Al composites with ideal microstructures and mechanical properties were successfully fabricated. The effect of Ti powder sizes on in-situ reaction, microstructures and mechanical properties of Al3Ti/Al composites were studied. The results show that the morphologies of Al3Ti particles and Î±-Al matrix are dominated by the original Ti powders. When the added Ti powders are too large (e.g. 60Â Î¼m and 40Â Î¼m) or too small (e.g. 10Â Î¼m), some agglomerated Al3Ti particles or blocks existed in the Î±-Al matrix. However, when the average size of added Ti powders is 20Â Î¼m, fine Al3Ti particles were formed and evenly distributed in the Î±-Al matrix. The refining mechanism of Î±-Al matrix was also discussed. The composites are significantly strengthened due to ultrasonic vibration and evenly distributed Al3Ti particles. The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation to fracture are 361Â MPa, 449Â MPa and 3.16%, respectively. The thermoplastic formability of in-situ Al3Ti/2024Al composites is similar with 2024 alloy.",0
"Elliptical vibration cutting is applied to ultra-precision machining of tungsten alloy molds for optical glass parts in the present research. The tungsten alloy is expected as a new mold material instead of conventional ones such as sintered tungsten carbide and CVD-silicon carbide. However, it cannot be finished precisely by ordinary cutting because of rapid tool wear, brittle fracture and adhesion to the tool. Therefore, the ultrasonic elliptical vibration cutting is applied to the ultra-precision machining of tungsten alloy. Practical ultra-precision molds are obtained by the elliptical vibration cutting, and they are applied to glass molding successfully.",0
"Undoped and cobalt-doped zinc oxide (CZO) polycrystalline piezoelectric thin films (Co: 3, 5 at.%) using a series of high quality ceramic targets have been deposited at 450Â°C onto glass substrates using a pulsed laser deposition method. The used source was a KrF excimer laser (248nm, 25ns, 2Jâcm2). X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the Co-doped ZnO films crystallize in a hexagonal wurtzite type structure with a strong (0 orientation, and the grain sizes calculated from these patterns decrease from 37 to 31nm by increasing Co doping. The optical waveguiding properties of the films were characterized by using a prism-coupling method. The distinct M-lines of the guided transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) modes of the ZnO films waveguide have been observed. With the aim of study the optical properties of the ZnO films, an accurate refractive index and thickness measurement apparatus was set up, which is called M-lines device. An evaluation of experimental uncertainty and calculation of the precision of the refractive index and thickness were developed on ZnO films.

"In this study, highly dense Si3N4 ceramics with excellent mechanical properties were fabricated using Mg2Si as a sintering additive by plasma-activated sintering at 1400â1500â¯Â°C. The effects of the sintering temperature and content of Mg2Si on the densification, microstructures, and mechanical properties of the Si3N4 ceramics were investigated. The mechanism responsible for the effect of Mg2Si in the promotion of the sinterability of Si3N4 is discussed. The results showed that the addition of Mg2Si could effectively remove the oxide layers on the Si3N4 particles and form a liquid phase during the sintering, promoting the densification and phase transition of the Si3N4 ceramics.

"Both focused electron and ion beams (FEB and FIB) were used for fabricating patterned nano-/micro-structures on the surfaces of an iron phosphate glass (FePO). Periodically arranged, nano-sized holes/tubes/rings with their walls being made of Fe nanoparticles were fabricated by FEB direct writing. The diameters of the holes/tubes can be controlled by the beam size and dwell time, as well as by subsequent electron irradiation.

For the first time comparison of some properties of the low-energy vibrational excitations and the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in glasses is carried out. It is found out that the position of low-frequency (boson) peak in Raman spectra correlates with the position of FSDP and changes of the boson peak intensity correlate with that of FSDP. These correlations confirm a connection of low-energy (2â10 meV) anomalies of vibrational spectra of glasses with characteristic length in their structure.,1

"An experimental study of the bulk magnetic properties (DC, AC susceptibility, specific heat) of the new two dimensional metal TbBrD x (0.67 â¤ Ã â¤ 1.0) is presented. By reducing the D concentration from xâ 1.0 to 0.7 a transition from long range magnetic ordering to spin-glass behavior is obtained. This observation, in analogy to amorphous rare-earth alloys is explained as mainly due to a random distribution of the vacancies in the D substructure giving rise to random magnetic anisotropies for Tb. In contrast to the amorphous alloys the sublattice carrying the magnetic moments is crystallographically well ordered.",0
"In-situ formed (Cu0.6Zr0.3Ti0.1)95Nb5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) composite with Nb-rich dendrite randomly dispersed in hard glassy matrix was prepared by casting into a water-cooled copper mold. The dendrite has much smaller hardness and elastic modulus than glassy matrix, and the stress concentration at interface provides a channel for the initiating and branching of shear bands upon loading, thus leading to a high compressive fracture strain of 6.08% and fracture strength about 2200 MPa. Comparing with other Cu-based BMG composite, the fracture strength of present (Cu0.6Zr0.3Ti0.1)95Nb5 composite is not significantly reduced, indicating that the addition of Nb in the current work is an effective and effortless way to fabricate new practical BMG composites with enhanced strength and good plasticity.",0

The optical properties of the synthesized glasses were experimentally and theoretically investigated in detail. The experimental and calculated oscillator strengths of Er3+ were determined by measurement of the absorption spectrum of Er3+-singly doped glass. According to the JuddâOfelt theory, the experimental intensity parameters were calculated, from which the radiative transition probabilities, fluorescence branching ratios and radiative lifetimes were obtained. The fluorescence lifetime and quantum efficiency for the near-infrared emission of Er3+-singly doped glass were determined to be 3.0ms, and 42%, respectively.

"Commercial AA7050 aluminium alloy in the solution heat-treated condition was processed by ECAP through routes A and BC. Samples were processed in both room temperature and 150Â°C, with 1, 3, and 6 passes. The resulting microstructure was evaluated by optical microscopy (OM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Only one pass was possible at room temperature due to the low ductility of the alloy under this condition. In all cases, the microstructure was refined by the formation of deformation bands, with dislocation cells and subgrains inside these bands. The increase of the ECAP temperature led to the formation of more defined subgrain boundaries and intense precipitation of spherical-like particles, identified as Î·â² and Î· phases. After the first pass, an increase in the hardness was observed, when compared with the initial condition. After 3 passes the hardness reached a maximum value, higher than the values typically observed for this alloy in the overaged condition. The samples processed by route BC evolved to a more refined microstructure. ECAP also resulted in significant strength improvement, compared to the alloy in the commercial overaged condition.",0

"Transparent conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass was fabricated by pulsed laser deposition using a Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 355 nm. ITO films were grown on glass substrate at various substrate temperatures (room temperature â¼500Â°C) and at different oxygen pressures (0â100 mTorr). Under an oxygen pressure of 20 mTorr, the lowest resistivity of 9.5567Ã10â5 Î© cm was obtained for ITO films deposited at 500Â°C. The optical and electrical properties of ITO films on glass are found to be dependent on the oxygen pressure and substrate temperature. The resistivity was decreased with an increase of substrate temperature owing to crystallinity, boundary scattering, and oxygen vacancies. The transmittance for the ITO films was about 80% at oxygen pressure over 20 mTorr. A four-point probe method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and UVâvisible spectrometry are used to investigate the electrical, structural, and optical properties of ITO films.",0
"Tungsten tellurite glasses (TeO2-WO3-ZrO2) doped with various concentrations of Yb3+ ions have been prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method and systematically studied their spectroscopic and laser properties. The spectroscopic properties and some of the laser parameters have been evaluated from the measured absorption and emission spectra. Emission cross-sections evaluated from the McCumber and the Fuchtbauer-Ladenburg methods are found to be in good agreement. The absorption and emission cross-sections are found to be in the range of 2.78â1.30 (Ã10â20 cm2) and 3.64â1.83 (Ã10â20 cm2), respectively, when Yb3+ ions concentration increases from 0.01 to 3.0mol%. A significant change in luminescence spectral profile for higher concentration (>0.1mol%) of Yb3+ ions has been explained as due to reabsorption effects. An initial increase of lifetime for the 2F5/2 level up to 0.5mol% and decrease thereafter for higher concentrations (>0.5mol%) of Yb3+ ions has been explained with a suitable mechanism. The results of spectroscopic and laser parameters indicate that tungsten-tellurite glasses have potential applications as gain media for lasers and optical amplifiers.",1

The main purpose of this work was to locate the optimal BMG-forming composition for the quaternary ZrCo(Cu)Al alloys and to improve the plasticity of the parent alloy. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate the glassy alloys structure and their glass forming ability (GFA). In addition, the compression test, microhardness, nano-indentation and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to discuss the possible mechanisms involved in the enhanced plasticity achievement. The highest GFA among Cu-containing alloys was found for the Zr56Co22Cu6Al16 alloy, which was similar to that of the base alloy. Furthermore, the plasticity of the base alloy increased significantly from 3.3% to 6% for the Zr56Co22Cu6Al16 BMG. The variations in the plasticity and GFA of the alloys were discussed by considering the positive heat of mixing within Cu and Co elements.",0

"Abstrtact In this study, the effectiveness of short glass fibre (SGF) reinforcements in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and blends of maleic anhydride grafted styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene/PET (MA-g-SEBS/PET) matrices have been investigated. One of the drawbacks for rubber toughening of polymers is the severe reduction in tensile properties (i.e. tensile modulus and tensile strength). With the incorporation of SGF into ternary SGF/rubber/PET blends, the resulting blends may possess attractive tensile and impact characteristics. From this research, it was observed that SGF is effective in improving the tensile modulus, tensile strength and notched impact strength in the SGF/PET binary blends. However, the presence of MA-g-SEBS rubber in the SGF/rubber/PET blends did not improve the notched impact strength, while the tensile properties were adversely affected. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination observed that in the ternary blends, a layer of MA-g-SEBS/PET matrix was coated onto the glass fibres. These coatings reduced the interfacial shear strength between the fibre and matrix, which gave rise to the severe reduction in tensile strength with increasing rubber content.",0

The corrosion resistance is however found to be enhanced with the increase in Co concentration. The addition of Co causes the enrichment of Zr and Al, but depletes Cu in the surface films, which effectively enhances the corrosion potential and lowers the corrosion current density.",0

"The frequency dependence of the internal friction (IF) of annealed Co-based metallic glass (MG) has been measured at elevated temperatures in the frequency range of 10â3â¤fâ¤103 Hz. It has been found that the IF increases with frequency decrease at a constant temperature. To explain this observation, an analytical model of IF due to anelastic relaxation in a symmetrical two-well potential has been proposed. The model shows that the IF rise with decreasing frequency observed in the experiment can be interpreted as a high frequency tail of a Snoek-like relaxation with distributed activation energies in deep relaxation centers of annealed glassy structure.",0
"This paper presents quasi-static crushing performance of empty and polyurethane foam-filled E-glass/vinylester composite tubes with different geometrical characteristics to use in sacrificial cladding structures. Some empty and foam-filled tubes were compressed laterally between two rigid plates. The effects of polyurethane foam-filler on the crushing characteristics and the corresponding energy absorption by the composite tubes are investigated. Composite tubes with three different fiber fabric layers were considered to study the influence of polyurethane foam on the crushing performance. Also, effects of different geometrical characteristics on energy absorption by different tubes are studied. Experimental results show that the presence of polyurethane foam inside the composite tubes suppresses the circumferential delimitation process and fiber fracturing; consequently, it increases the specific absorbed energy by the composite tubes during the flattening process. Also, it is resulted that injection of the polyurethane foam in the tubes causes the more regular deformation mode, comparing with the empty tubes. Finally, experimental results of the present work are compared with some of the previous articles that were investigated the foam-filled composite structures under the different loadings to suggest an optimized energy absorber.",0

"Borogermanate scintillating glasses with composition of 25B2O3â40GeO2â2Eu2O3â33RE2O3 (RE=Y, La and Gd) were synthesized by melt-quenching method. The effect of RE2O3 on the glass structure and performance including the density, transmittance as well as luminescent properties under both ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray excitation were compared and studied systematically. The enhanced intensity of Eu3+ emission under X-ray excitation is remarkably higher than that under UV excitation. The temperature-dependent emission spectra in the 75â295K temperature region reveal that the thermal quenching behavior of Eu3+ luminescence in Y2O3-based glass is slightly better than that in La2O3- or Gd2O3-based one. The covalency property of EuO bond and the local environment of Eu3+ ions is evaluated by the values of Î© t parameter by employing the JuddâOfelt analysis. The possible interconnection among the covalency nature of EuO bond, the thermal quenching behavior of Eu3+ emission, and the thermal stability of the designed borogermanate scintillating is also discussed.",1
"A series of sodium borophosphate glasses of the composition (1âx)NaPO3âxB2O3 have been synthesised from Na2CO3, B2O3 and P2O5 and their optical and thermal properties investigated. The results show that refractive index (n) and glass transition temperature (T g) show a maximum at about B/(B+P)=0.6 while thermal expansion coefficient (Î±) and thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) change monotonically with the B/(B+P) ratio. These observations can be interpreted based on the incorporation of BO3 and BO4 units into the glass structural network.",1
"A joint of Zr55Cu30Ni5Al10 bulk metallic glass to crystalline material (Al-5Fe alloy) was achieved successfully by the pre-friction assisted diffusion bonding. This method employed the pre-friction process to break the oxide film of bulk metallic glass specimens. The average tensile strength was 58.42MPa, which is much higher than CDB. The bulk metallic glass workpieces after joining retained the unique amorphous structure, indicating that thermal cycle, microscopic deformation and interface atomic diffusion caused no micro-structural transformation of amorphous state. The pre-friction assisted diffusion bonding mechanism was proposed, which showed that the pre-friction process played a role of breaking the oxide film and providing a favorable diffusion bonding condition.",0
"The optical behaviour of Tm3+-Yb3+ codoped tellurite glass in presence of Li2CO3 and TiO2 modifiers, prepared by conventional melt and quench technique has been investigated with the help of NIR-Visible UC study. The generation of the visible UC bands around â¼ 476nm, â¼702nm, â¼795nm and a weak peak around â¼ 653nm, due to the 1G4â 3H6, 3F2â 3H6, 3H4â 3H6 and 1G4â 3F4, transitions respectively under 980 nm excitation have been discussed in detail with the help of energy level diagram.",1
"The synthesis and characterization of the mesoporous materials FSM-16 (folded sheets mesoporous materials) with highly ordered structure in open-vessel by using cetylpyridium bromide (CPBr) and the single-layered polysilica Kanemite as new template and silicon source, respectively, has been investigated systematically. The hexagonal arrangements of uniformly size pores were characterized by FTIR, XRD, nitrogen adsorption, TG-DTA, SEM and TEM. Especially, the porous products with higher surface areas show remarkable thermal stability up to 1000Â°C. The potential application as carrier of catalysts or host-guest materials is anticipated.",1
"The friction and wear behaviours of four low purity commercial alumina ceramics coupled with the same high purity alumina were investigated. Tribological tests were carried out using a pin-on-disc apparatus in unlubricated conditions, in air, at room temperature, at different sliding speeds, on the same sliding distance and under the same applied load. The dependence of the tribological behaviour of the sliding alumina ceramics is discussed in terms of microstructural features such as grain size and content of secondary phase. The objective of the present research was to obtain a better understanding of the role of the microstructural parameters and how they can influence the friction and wear behaviours of low purity alumina ceramics. The contradictory behaviour of the lowest purity alumina is attributed to the microstructural characteristics of the material and in particular the presence of the secondary phase.",0
"The weld spot of (Ti41Zr25Be28Fe6)93Cu7 bulk metallic glass is characterized after friction stir spot welding. The mechanical and thermal properties of different zones of the weld spot are studied using X-ray diffraction, Vickers micro hardness, nanoindentation and differential scanning calorimetry. Base metal (BM), stir zone under the tool shoulder and around the tool tip (SSZ), stir zone under the tool tip (TSZ) and thermos-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ); have been identified in the weld spot. The TMAZ reveals the minimum hardness, while the TSZ presents the lowest elastic modulus and the greatest thermal stability. The highest hardness and elastic modulus and also the less thermal stability are observed in the SSZ. Analysis of the pop-in marks on the P - h curves verifies the formation of tensile stress in the TSZ, creation of the excess free volume in the TMAZ and the formation of nanocrystals in the SSZ during welding.",0
"The effects of minor additions of Nb (2, 3 and 4at%) to the Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 alloy are discussed in terms of microstructure, thermal behavior, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The addition of Nb promotes the formation of nanocrystals, i.e., from a completely amorphous structure (when no Nb is added) to a mainly crystalline structure (for a 4% of Nb addition). The glassy alloy exhibits large hardness, relatively low Young's modulus and excellent corrosion behavior, although the plasticity is rather limited. A significant increase in compressive plasticity (total strain over 13%) is achieved in the sample with 3% of Nb without compromising the strength. Young's modulus of the as-cast alloy (around 100GPa, as determined from acoustic measurements) increases only slightly when disperse nanocrystallites are embedded in the amorphous matrix. Improvement of the corrosion performance, with delayed pitting corrosion, is also observed for 3% Nb addition.",0
"Hybrid composites containing more than one type of high performance fibers show better mechanical properties than traditional composites reinforced with one kind of fibers. This paper investigated the static and fatigue flexural properties of a newly designed 3D orthogonal carbon/glass fibers hybrid composite. The flexural properties of the 3D orthogonal carbon fibers composites and the laminated carbon/glass fibers hybrid composite were discussed to reveal the advantages of the static flexural properties of the 3D orthogonal carbon/glass fibers hybrid composite. 50%, 55%, and 60% of the maximum stress of the 3D orthogonal and laminated carbon/glass fibers hybrid composites were respectively selected for the three-point bending fatigue test. The failure propagation of the composites and their fracture morphologies were captured in detail using the 3D microscope. The results found that the 3D integrated structure and hybrid effects resulted in the 3D orthogonal carbon/glass fibers hybrid composite showing the best static flexural strength. The fatigue performance of the 3D orthogonal carbon/glass fibers hybrid composite was superior to the laminated carbon/glass fibers hybrid composite since Z-direction yarns were beneficial to resist the interface failure. The stress levels contributed to the variations of the failure modes of the composites under three-point bending fatigue loading.",0
"Iron-based alloys were deposited on the low carbon steel by plasma cladding process. Furnace annealing was conducted at 600Â°C for 40min. Resulting microstructure and phases were observed and investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Effect of post heat treatment on the mechanical properties of coatings was also studied by instrumented indentation technique. It was found that solid solution Î³-(Fe, Ni, Cr) and carbide reinforced phases Cr7C3 were the main phases of as-cladding coatings while iron carbide became the main carbide reinforced phase for annealed coatings. For all coatings, hardness and reduced elastic modulus showed obvious load dependence, namely decreased with the indentation load increasing. It was found that calculated values of annealed coatings were generally lower than those of as-cladding coatings as a result of the dissolution of the eutectic structure which decreased the effect of dispersion strengthening.",0
"A novel ductile Fe56Ni20Mo4P11C4B4Si1 bulk metallic glass (BMG) with saturation magnetic flux density of 0.93â¯T, coercivity of 1.9 A/m and plastic strain of 7% was successfully synthesized in this work. Effects of Ni and Si additions on mechanical properties and serrated flow behavior of Fe-Mo-P-C-B BMGs were systematically investigated. It was found that the simultaneous additions of Ni and Si are effective to improve the plasticity of Fe76Mo4P12C4B4 BMG as indicated by the increase in the plastic strain from 1.7% to 7%. Serrated flow behavior is not observed in Fe76Mo4P12C4B4 BMG. However, the chaos state occurs in Fe56Ni20Mo4P12C4B4 BMG, and eventually the self-organized critical (SOC) behavior appears in Fe56Ni20Mo4P11C4B4Si1 BMG. The stable shear-band dynamics leads to the formation of multiple shear bands, resulting in a complex deformation process follow the SOC dynamics. The improved plasticity might result from an increased number of potential shear transition zone sites, and a stronger tendency of forming shear band interactions. This work provides a perspective from serrated flow behavior to understand plastic deformation mechanism in Fe-based BMGs with different plasticity.",0
"This numerical investigation of relaxation treats the Coulomb glass, i.e., a disordered many-electron system with long-range Coulomb interaction. The thermodynamic properties of the system like the Edwards-Anderson order parameter are examined by means of the Metropolis algorithm. By a slight modification of this algorithm, all low-lying states are determined. The transition probabilities between these states at low temperatures are derived. The corresponding rate equation is diagonalized in order to described the exact time evolution of excited states. Many timescales occur in the relaxation. A glassy behaviour of the electronic system is obtained.",1
Behaviour of longitudinal magnetic dipolar fluctuations in vicinity of the quadrupolar phase transition point in the paramagnetic range of some thulium cubic intermettalic compounds has been discussed. It was shown that halfwidth of the magnetic central peak at the temperature of quadrupolar phase transition diminishes evidently in a static external magnetic field. Temperature dependence of the width of the magnetic central peak in a strong magnetic field shows up the minimum value at the quadrupolar phase transition point. The analysis of the width of the central magnetic mode in scattering experiments provides a new method of observation of the quadrupolar phase transition.,0
"Dilution of LaMn1âx MxO3 with a main-group trivalent M = Sc or Al atom is compared to the case M = Ga in order to confirm the generality of a vibronic ferromagnetic Mn(III)âOâMn(III) superexchange interaction and stabilization of orbital disorder by a magnetizing field. A spin-glass to ferromagnet transition in a modest applied magnetic field has been found in the single-valent perovskite system LaMn1âx ScxO3 as in the analogous system LaMn1âx GaxO3; the coexistence of a ferromagnetic phase and an antiferromagnetic phase at low temperatures extends to compositions where the orthorhombic room-temperature axial ratio is c/ 2 >a. The Sc(III) ion is more resistant to a cooperative, static ordering of the Mn(III) e-orbitals than is Ga(III); the Al(III) ion is less resistant than Ga(III). The data for these insulators confirm the existence of a ferromagnetic vibronic-superexchange interaction between octahedral-site, high-spin Mn(III) with fluctuating e-orbitals and stabilization by an applied magnetic field of the orbitally disordered, ferromagnetic phase relative to the orbitally ordered antiferromagnetic phase. A similar spin-glass to ferromagnet transition in the mixed-valent La1âx SrxMnO3 system at compositions exhibiting the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) phenomenon supports the coexistence of ferromagnetic vibronic-superexchange and double-exchange interactions in the ferromagnetic phase and correlation bags rather than conventional magnetic polarons in the paramagnetic phase of the CMR manganites.",0
"The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of intra-ply hybrid patches based on glass and Kevlar woven fabrics on the local bending response of adhesive bonded external patch repairs in damaged glass/epoxy composite laminates. In intra ply hybrid patches glass and Kevlar fibre reinforcements are combined in the same layer. The intention, in using these hybrid patches, is to combine the excellent mechanical properties of glass fiber as a brittle reinforcement with the superior high elongation to failure property of Kevlar fiber as a ductile reinforcement. Five different kinds of plain weave woven fabrics with different ratios between glass and Kevlar fibers (100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100) were used as the external patches. The undamaged virgin specimens were taken as a reference for the comparison of residual mechanical properties. Multiple quasi-static indentation tests were carried out on repaired glass/epoxy specimens, and their ultimate indentation load, stiffness and permanent deformation were estimated. Failure mechanisms of repaired glass/epoxy specimens under indentation loads were investigated using online Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring technique. The indentation loads required for the occurrence of various failure modes were measured to illustrate the chronology of progression of different damage modes with increasing load and the kinetics of the various damage modes individually defined in real time. The use of different hybrid patches had a significant effect on the local bending response of the repaired glass/epoxy specimens. In practice, specimens repaired with patches including equal volume fraction of glass and Kevlar fibers presented a more favorable indentation response than virgin ones and other repaired specimens by exhibiting balanced mechanical properties (i.e., high deflection to ultimate failure associated with superior patch-parent laminate bond strength).",0
"â¢ Objective. Several methacrylate/glass ionomer hybrid materials are now available for clinical use as restorative filling materials. However, the long-term resistance of these materials to physical degradation in the humid oral condition is not known. The objective of this investigation was to determine the mechanical properties, e.g., ultimate compressive strength and diametral tensile strength, of several glass ionomer materials as a function of time after aging in water at oral temperature. â¢ Methods. Eight glass ionomer filling materials indicated for restorative or core build-up applications were studied. Three conventional glass ionomers, two metal-containing conventional glass ionomers and three methacrylate-modified systems were included in the study. Cured specimens of each were aged in distilled water at 37Â°C for 24 h, 1 wk, 4 wk, 12 wk, 24 wk and 52 wk. â¢ Results. Like the conventional glass ionomers, the methacrylate-modified glass ionomers of this study, with one exception, did not exhibit a decrease in compressive strength, modulus and diametral tensile strength as a result of prolonged storage in water at oral temperature. Some differences among the various groups were apparent. The compressive strengths of the conventional glass ionomers were lower than the methacrylate-modified system, except for one material, Fuji II (GC Dental Corp.), of the former group. A significant difference in the compressive strength was seen between the encapsulated and hand-mixed versions of the same commercial brand product. The compressive modulus was higher and the diametral tensile strength was lower for the conventional systems indicating that, as a group, these materials are more brittle than the methacrylate-modified hybrid ionomers. With the exception of VariGlass VLC (L.D. Caulk), most of the materials studied showed little decrease in mechanical properties after aging in water for 52 wk. â¢ Significance. These materials could, therefore, be indicated for use in applications where they are in contact with oral fluids under physiological conditions.",0
"Zinc barium borotellurite glass samples were synthesized with the chemical composition of 10ZnOâ30BaOâ30B2O3-(30-x)TeO2-xSm2O3 (where 0.05â¯â¤â¯xâ¯â¤â¯1.50 in mol%). Several techniques for XRD, FTIR, absorption, luminescence and decay time measurements were used to investigate the structural and spectroscopic properties. It was found that the XRD patterns revealed amorphous nature of the glass samples. The structural modification of (TeO4) trigonal bipyramid structural units was observed using FTIR spectroscopy. The UVâVISâNIR absorption spectra displayed seven absorption peaks corresponding to the energy transitions from the ground level 6H5/2 to 6F11/2 (947â¯nm), 6F9/2 (1085â¯nm), 6F7/2(1238â¯nm), 6F5/2 (1385â¯nm), 6F3/2 (1492â¯nm), 6H15/2 (1550â¯nm), and 6F1/2 (1589â¯nm) excited levels of Sm3+ ion. For the emission spectra, four peaks revealed the transitions 4G5/2â¯ââ¯6H5/2 (563â¯nm), 6H7/2 (601â¯nm), 6H9/2 (644â¯nm) and 6H11/2 (705â¯nm). The phenomenological intensity parameters Î©Î» (Î»â¯=â¯2, 4, 6) according to JuddâOfelt theory were calculated. The J-O parameters have been used to forecast several radiative properties such as transition probability (AR), branching ratio (Î²R) and stimulated emission-cross-sections (Ïp) in 4G5/2 excitation level of samarium ion. The decay patterns of the 4G5/2 level were fitted using non exponential as well as InokutiâHirayama (IH) model. The luminescence spectra of Sm3+ ion of the glasses was analyzed with The CIE chromaticity color coordinates. According to the CIE coordinates, it was located in the boundary of orange light in the CIE diagram. All of the results indicated that these glass compositions could be used for preparing a material which will be a potential candidate for laser applications.",1
"Kinetics of crystallization in Bi3Sr2Ca2Cu3âx Sn x O10+Î´ (x=0.05, 0.10 and 0.15) glass was studied by the non-isothermal method using differential thermal analysis (DTA). In this order, the DTA curves have been registered with different heating rates (5, 10, 15 and 20Â°Cminâ1) up to 900Â°C. The glass transition temperature, crystallization temperature and nature of crystalline phases formed were determined. From the variation of DTA peak maximum temperature with heating rate, the activation energies of crystallization were calculated to be 337, 344 and 367kJmolâ1 for x=0.05, 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, by using the Kissinger method. The values of the Avrami exponent (n) were 2.34, 2.76 and 3.84 for x=0.05, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. The glass transition temperature varies from 451.2 to 475.0Â°C depending on the composition of the glass.",1
"Lanthanum calcium phosphate oxide and oxyfluoride glasses doped with dysprosium oxide were prepared by melt-quenching technique with chemical composition 20La2O3:10CaO:69P2O5:1Dy2O3 and 20La2O3:10CaF2:69P2O5:1Dy2O3. The physical, optical and luminescence properties of the glass samples were studied to evaluate their potential to using as luminescence materials for solid-state lighting applications. The density, molar volume and refractive index of the glass samples were carried out. The optical and luminescence properties were studied by investigating absorption, excitation, and emission spectra of the glass samples. The absorption spectra were investigated in the UVâVisâNIR region from 300 to 2000Â nm. The excitation spectra observed under 574Â nm emission wavelength showed the highest peak centered at 349Â nm (6H15/2Â âÂ 6P7/2). The emission spectra, excited with 349Â nm excitation wavelength showed two major peaks corresponding to 482Â nm blue emission (4F9/2Â âÂ 6H15/2) and 574Â nm yellow emission (4F9/2Â âÂ 6H13/2). The experimental lifetime were found to be 0.539 and 0.540 for oxide and oxyfluoride glass sample, respectively. The x,y color coordinates under 349Â nm excitation wavelength were (0.38, 0.43) for both glass samples, that be plotted in white region of CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram. The CCT values obtained from the glass samples are 4204Â K for oxide glass and 4228Â K for oxyfluoride glass corresponding to the commercial cool white light (3100â4500Â K). Judd-Ofelt theory had also been employed to obtain the J-O parameters (Î©2, Î©4 and Î©6), oscillator strength, radiative transition possibility, stimulated emission cross section and branching ratio. The Î©2Â >Â Î©4Â >Â Î©6 trend of J-O parameters of both glass samples may indicate the good quality of a glass host for using as optical device application. Temperature dependence of emission spectra was studied from 300Â K to 10Â K and found that the intensity of the emission peak was found to be increased with decreasing of the temperature. The results of the investigations in this work confirmed that the present Dy-doped lanthanum calcium phosphate oxide and oxyfluoride glasses perform high potential for using as efficient luminescence materials for solid-state lighting applications, especially for white LEDs. Furthermore, the oxyfluoride glass sample provides more luminescence potential than the oxide glass sample.",1
"Textile Reinforced Mortar (TRM) is an innovative technology in which high strength textile is embedded in cementitious mortar. The cementitious mortar used for TRM must possess high strength, stiffness and ductility for strengthening applications. The present study was conducted on glass fibre textile reinforced mortar by fine aggregate partially replaced by fly ash. The cementitious mortar was developed with fine aggregate partially replaced by varying percentage fly ash and compressive strength was evaluated. The optimum compressive strength and tensile strength was obtained at fly ash replacement percentage of 60% of the fine aggregate. Tensile strength of glass fibre TRM laminates was evaluated for different thickness of the laminate. The strength and stiffness of TRM specimens increases as the percentage fine aggregate replacement increases. As the thickness of the TRM specimens increases, the tensile capacity increases linearly up to 10â¯mm thickness, beyond which the rate of tensile strength development decreases.",0
"The rotational eigenfunctions of asymmetric top molecules are linear combinations of symmetric top eigenfunctions, either in the prolate or in the oblate limit. Transition selection rules and intensities can be easily treated if one symmetric top function is dominant in the combinations (near-symmetric top limits). In this case, a spectrum is rather similar to that of a symmetric top, but line splitting occurs, due to the breakdown of the degeneracy of pairs of levels with the same value of |k| (asymmetry splitting). For large asymmetry, the symmetry properties of a rotational state can be found by its correlation with the two symmetric top limits. This allows one to find selection rules in the parities of the limit quantum numbers ka and kc . Special selection rules for the most intense transition lines are also discussed.",0
"Ni-base alloys with different Al contents of 0â10wt.% were designed and the corrosion behaviour was evaluated by static immersion in molten glass at 1050Â°C. Results indicate that a small amount of Al (2â5wt.%) is advantageous to mitigate the corrosion of the commercial Ni-base alloy, whereas further increase of Al content (8â10wt.%) accelerates the corrosion process. In Al-added alloys, the corrosion of Cr element is suppressed by the Al dissolution, and the formation of inner alumina in high Al alloys leads to the surface exfoliation. The corrosion mechanism strongly depends on the Al content in alloys.",0
"We have measured the IâV curves of Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 thin films at different temperatures in fixed magnetic field. The curves collapsed nicely onto two branches by plotting V/I/|T â T g| v(zâ1) vs. I/T|T g â T|2v , with the temperature T g, critical exponents v and z determined from experiments. When T < 0.9T g, the IâV curves collapsed onto a straight line by plotting log (R/R min) vs. â(I min/I) Î¼ with the exponent Î¼ in the range of 0.27 to 0.50. These characteristics support the existence of a continuous phase transition at T g from vortex-liquid to vortex-glass phase in Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8.",0
"The effects of phase separation on the viscosity of glass-forming liquids has been investigated using a fiber-elongation technique. The materials studied were a borosilicate glass and a 0.14 Na2OÂ·0.86 SiO2 glass. In the latter case, the viscosity has been measured at temperatures of 501 and 555 Â°C, and found to depend strongly on the extent, scale, and morphology of the phase separation. The faster development of a large-scale interconnected submicrostructure at 555 Â°C has been associated with the viscosity of samples tested at this temperature being higher than those at 501 Â°C, for tests up to about one mouth in duration. The borosilicate glass was tested at temperatures of 536, 482, 460, and 448 Â°C. In contrast with the results obtained previously on a homogeneous rubidium silicate glass, no evidence for non-Newtonian behavior was found on this phase-separated glass, even for tensile stresses as large as 2.3 Ã 1010 dyne/cm2.",1
"A strong interfacial bonded 45S5 glass-ceramic coating was fabricated on AZ31B magnesium alloy using a solâgel dip-coating technique followed by thermal treatment at temperature of 480Â°C and different Ar pressures. When the pressure was 0.6MPa and held for 90min, the bonding strength reached 26.8MPa, much higher than that of samples thermally treated at the same temperature without any pressure. The strong interfacial bonding strength is mainly attributed to the solid solution reaction accelerated by the atomic diffusion due to the pressure.",0
"Frequency upconversion (UC) photoluminescence (PL) in GeO2-PbO glass codoped with trivalent ions of neodymium (Nd3+) and ytterbium (Yb3+) is reported. A diode laser operating at 977.7Â nm, in resonance with the ytterbium transition 2F7/2Â âÂ 2F5/2, was the excitation source. Four PL spectral lines, corresponding to the Nd3+ transitions 4G9/2Â âÂ 4I9/2 (at 500Â nm), 4G7/2Â âÂ 4I9/2 (at 550Â nm), [4G5/2; 2G7/2]Â âÂ 4I11/2 (at 595Â nm) and 4G7/2Â âÂ 4I13/2 (at 660Â nm), were observed and characterized. The quadratic dependence of the PL intensities versus the laser power indicates that two laser photons participate in the UC process. The temperature dependence of the PL emissions from 300 to 390Â K was also investigated to identify the contribution of phonons for the UC process. The dependence of the UC intensity with the Yb3+ concentration and the time behavior of the UC signal indicated the presence of two energy transfer (ET) pathways involving Nd3+-Yb3+ pairs and Yb3+-Nd3+-Yb3+ triads. Rate-equations for the population densities of the rare-earth energy levels were used to describe the dynamics of the UC emission and to determine the ET rates.",1
"Ribbons of amorphous Cu-Ti-Ni alloys were prepared by the melt spinning method. The amorphous structure of these ribbons was confirmed by X-ray diffractametry and transmission electron microscopy. The effect of Ni on the glass-forming ability of Cu-Ti-based alloys was studied by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC). It is found that the supercooled liquid region, ÎTx value shows the maximum value of 61Â°C at x=10 in the Cu50Ti50-x Ni x (x=0, 5, 10, 15 mole fraction, %) system. And the reduced glass transition temperature, T rg, is smaller than 0.45. The glass forming ability(GFA) of Cu-Ti alloy is not effectively promoted by Ni addition.",0
"Optical absorption and emission spectra and relaxation of Eu3+ ions and of Cr3+ impurities in a Eu(PO3)3 glass are reported. Europium fluorescence occurs from the 5 D 0 state with near-unity quantum efficiency at low emperatures. The Cr3+ fluorescence occurs in the form of a broadband emission in the near-infrared which is attributed to Stokes-shifted 4 T 2â4 A 2 transitions. The Eu3+ emission overlaps the Cr3+ absorption bands and both radiative and nonradiative Eu3+âCr3+ energy transfer were observed. To investigate the transfer processes, the Eu3+ fluoresence decays were measured as a function of temperature and chromium concentration. The results indicate that nonradiative energy transfer involves a combination of energy migration through the Eu3+ system and transfer to fast-relaxing Cr3+ ions which act as quenching centers.",1
"The effects of partial substitution of Ni by Pd in the high-Zr-based Zr65Al10Ni25-xPdx (at.%, xÂ =Â 0, 5 and 10) alloys on their glass-forming ability (GFA), crystallization kinetics and mechanical property were investigated. The critical diameter for glass formation is increased from 3Â mm for Zr65Al10Ni25 alloy to 5Â mm for Zr65Al10Ni15Pd10. An icosahedral quasicrystal phase precipitates in the amorphous matrix in the first crystallization step of Zr-Al-Ni-Pd BMGs, implying that strong icosahedral short/medium-range order (IS/MRO) may exist in the Pd-containing alloys. In additional, Pd-bearing Zr-based BMGs present a lower Avrami exponent n indicating the higher stabilization of the supercooled liquid. Moreover, the Zr-Al-Ni-Pd BMGs exhibit larger compressive plasticity, higher notch toughness and Poisson's ratio than those of Zr65Al10Ni25 alloy, which can be correlated with the existence of strong IS/MRO clusters in amorphous phase.",0
"The sintering behaviour of magnetic bulk glassy compact has been addressed. Rapidly quenched ribbons of Fe71Nb3.7Cu1Al3Mn0.8Si13.5B7 alloy were ball milled to powder and consolidated using binder to get bulk glassy compacts. Structural and crystallization behaviour of glassy and heat-treated powders was evaluated. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the powders showed transition from amorphous to nanocrystalline phase at 800K. Magnetic evaluation of the bulk glassy cores revealed best soft magnetic property at a sintering temperature of 775K which was due to the formation of Î±-Fe(Si,Al) and Fe3(Si,Al) nanoparticles evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray analysis. However, at this temperature the glassy compact exhibited low value of remanence, which was attributed to the demagnetization field due to porosity in the material that developed from the escaped mineral binder. At subsequent higher sintering temperature of 785K the glassy core exhibited inferior soft magnetic properties with a low coercivity due to the formation of strongly anisotropic boride phases. Remanence value increased due to reduced demagnetization effect arising from a more compact morphology. Such reduced porosity was due to the coalescence of powder particle as observed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",0
Crystalline titania thin films were obtained on glass and various kinds of organic substrates at 40â70Â°C by deposition from aqueous solutions of titanium tetrafluoride. Transparent films consisting of small anatase particles (â¼20 nm) exhibited excellent adhesion to relatively hydrophilic surfaces. Uniform coatings were successfully prepared on substrates with complex shapes such as cotton and felt fiber. Growth rate and particle size were controlled by both the deposition conditions and the addition of an organic surfactant. Organic dyes were incorporated into the anatase films using organic-dye dissolving solutions and a surfactant. The photo-catalytic property of the titania films deposited in the precursor solutions at relatively low temperatures was identified as that of thermally crystallized anatase.,0
"Intermetallic compound Al3Ti or intermetallic compound matrix composite (IMC) surface layers were formed on Al surface by laser cladding. To form sound IMC surface layers, laser conditions must be controlled to suppress the melting of base metal. With increasing the volume fraction of ceramics in the IMC layer, it needed higher laser power to obtain IMC layer although the control of laser conditions became easier. During laser cladding, TiB2 melted by laser irradiation and then homogeneously precipitated as fine particles at a cooling stage. On the contrary, TiC and SiC hardly melted and were dispersed in Al3Ti matrix. SiC reacted with Ti to form titanium-silicide or TiC, which made the composition of matrix richer in Al than Al3Ti and caused degradation of the wear property. IMC surface layer improved the wear property of Al substrate. The particle size as well as volume fraction of dispersoid ceramics affected the wear property.",0
"A variety of materials are added to concrete so as to improve its mechanical behavior. Moreover, it can help reduce the environmental pollution by replacing certain waste materials as cement or aggregate. This study involved waste glass as a replacement for aggregate. The polypropylene fiber was added to the glass-containing concrete so as to improve its behavior at different percentages (0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5%). Replacement of glass as aggregate can curtail the compressive and tensile strengths of the concrete. Furthermore, fibers enhance the tensile strength and slightly reduce the compressive strength of the concrete. Glass and fibers in concrete reduce slump. Therefore, the slump required by the concrete can be supplied by adding a lubricant. There were eighty cubic specimens (15cm) constructed to investigate the compressive strength as well as sixty concrete beams (10*10*40cm) to evaluate the flexural behavior of the glass-containing concrete and polypropylene fibers. The results demonstrated that the addition of 0.5â1% of fibers to the glass-containing concrete can enhance the compressive strength of the glass-containing fiber-free concrete. The flexural strength of the concrete containing 50â70% of glass entails variations of less than 1%.",0
"The loss mechanism in the Pr3+âYb3+ codoped glass that showed quantum cutting (QC) phenomenon was investigated and we found that the multi-phonon relaxation from Pr3+:1G4 is the major loss to the quantum cutting process. To reduce the loss, Pr3+âYb3+ codoped glass ceramics containing SrF2 crystals were prepared and quantum yields (QY) of Yb3+ emission by 440nm excitation were measured. Only glass ceramics with the highest Yb concentration (x =2.9) showed higher QY than that of the as-made glass. It is considered that in low Yb concentration Pr3+ and Yb3+ ions were divided into different matrix possibly because of different ionic radius between Pr3+ and Yb3+ ions.",1
"In order to explore the effect of residual stress state on the mechanical properties of BMGs, we utilized the laser surface melting to tune the residual stress distribution via changing the processing angle between the laser scanning direction and the axial direction in the Zr55Al10Ni5Cu30 BMG. It was found that the laser processing angle has a significant effect on the plasticity of the treated specimens. The improved plastic strains of the specimens treated by 60Â° and 90Â° laser processing angles are almost twice those of 0Â° and 30Â° treated specimens. Via finite element analysis, the variation of residual stress distribution with the processing angle was characterized, and the correlation between the residual stress state and the plasticity was discussed. This study could be expected to aid in the wide application of surface treatment for improving the mechanical properties of BMGs.",0
PbSe quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized in borosilicate glass and their optical properties were investigated. The typical quantum confinement effects were clearly observed from the absorption when the average radii of the QDs changed from 1.7 to 3.1nm. Photoluminescence from PbSe QDs was achieved in 1.1â2.2Î¼m wavelength region that covers the entire fiber-optic telecommunication window. Borosilicate glasses containing controlled size of PbSe QDs provide potentials for the fiber-optic amplifiers.,1
The correlation times of random moments in Cu Mn (0.8 at%) have been obtained from the zero-field spin relaxation of positive muon. The correlation time has been found to vary rapidly over a very wide range from 10â5â10â10 s in the temperature region 0.5T g âª T âª 1.5T g.,0
Low field static magnetization and susceptibility measurements have been made in Co rich AlCo alloys. The experiments were carried out in the temperature range 4.2â80 K by using magnetic fields well below 100 mT. The results reveal cluster spin glass behavior with the associated history and time dependent effects for Co concentrations exceeding 51 at %. Below this concentration the temperature dependence of the susceptibility follows the Curie-Weiss law in the considered range of temperatures.,0
"The surface morphology of in situ deformed, pre-deformed, undeformed and crystallized Zr47.9Ti0.3Ni3.1Cu39.3Al9.4 bulk metallic glass in air at elevated temperatures are investigated to improve the understanding of the effect of plastic deformation on the oxidation. The plastic deformation is performed through instrumental macroindentation, while could provide a well developed shear offset pattern around the indents at lower temperatures. The oxidation experimental results show that the in situ formed and pre-existed shear bands are more susceptible to oxidation. The plastic deformation region during homogenous deformation has also a significant oxidation sensitivity compared with undeformed material. To clarify the oxidation mechanism of shear band, specimens with surface scratches were also studied. The mechanism for the preferential oxidation of shear bands and of the plastic deformation region is discussed.",0
"The photocatalytic oxidation of solutions of formic acid over supported semiconducting ceramic membranes has been investigated. Sol-gel techniques were employed to coat pyrex glass supports with colloidal solutions. Subsequent firing leads to supported ceramic membranes suitable for use as photocatalysts. The structure of these membranes affects the rate of photocatalytic oxidation of formic acid. The most active titania photocatalysts are those membranes characterized by the least number of boundaries between particles. Titania membranes doped with vanadium, molybdenum, yttrium, magnesium, lithium and rutherium oxides and platinum metal have been prepared. Only those titania membranes doped with magnesium oxide, lithium oxide or platinum metal were characterized by higher activities for the degradation of formic acid than the original titania membranes. The rate of this degradation reaction can be characterized by an expression of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson form.",0
"In order to study the recycling of discarded liquid crystal display (LCD) glass into concrete (LCDGC), a portion of the usual river sand was replaced by sand prepared from discarded LCD glass. Three different mix designs were regulated by the ACI method (fc28 =21, 28, and 35MPa) with 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% LCD glass sand replacements investigated; their engineering properties were determined. Test results revealed that, when compared to the design slump of 15cm, the 20% glass sand concrete for the three different mix designs kept good slump and slump flow. Furthermore, a slump loss ranging from 7 to 11cm was observed for specimens with 60% and 80% glass sand replacement for the design strengths of 28 and 35MPa. The compressive strengths of the concrete with glass sand replacement were higher than the design strengths. Moreover, the durability of the concrete with 20% glass sand replacement was better than that of the control group. Surface resistivity for specimens with different amounts of LCD glass sand replacement was also higher than that in the control group for mid to long curing ages. The sulfate attack in concrete with different amounts of glass sand replacement caused less weight loss than in the control group. Moderate chloride ion penetration was observed for glass sand concrete. Furthermore, the measured ultrasonic pulse velocities for LCD glass sand concrete specimens were higher than 4100m/s, which qualified these specimens as good concrete. OM and SEM indicate that the dense CâSâH gel hydrate was produced at the interface between the glass sand and cement paste. The test results indicate that the addition of 20% LCD glass sand to concrete satisfies the slump requirements and improves the strength and durability of concrete. This suggests that LCD glass sand can potentially be used as a recycled material in concrete applications.",0
"Ac-susceptibility measurements at various temperatures and hysteresis studies at various fields indicate that the system Ge x Cu1âx Fe2O4 (x â©½ 0.6) contains mixed multidomain, single domain or superparamagnetic states. Sharp susceptibility maxmima, resembling those of spin glasses, are observed for x = 0.1 and 0.2, which may be attributed to the single domain-superparamagnetic (SDî¸SP) transition and the overall behaviour shows a cluster spin glass type of ordering.",0
"Niobium containing tellurium calcium zinc borate (TCZNB) glasses doped with different concentrations of Dy3+ ions were prepared by the melt quenching method and their optical properties have been studied. The JuddâOfelt (JâO) intensity parameters Î© t (t=2, 4 and 6) were calculated using the least square fit method. Based on the magnitude of Î© 2 parameter the hypersensitivity of 6H15/2â6F11/2 has also been discussed. From the evaluated JâO intensity parameters as well as from the emission and lifetime measurements, radiative transition properties such as radiative transition probability rates and branching ratios were calculated for 4F9/2 excited level. It is found that for Dy3+ ion, the transition 4F9/2â6H13/2 shows highest emission cross-section at 1.0mol% TCZNB glass matrix. From the visible luminescence spectra, yellow to blue (Y/B) intensity ratios and chromaticity color coordinates were also estimated. The TCZNB glasses exhibit good luminescence properties and are suitable for generation of white light.",1
"Up-conversion of infrared radiation to the visible and ultraviolet regions in PbF2âGeO2âAl2O3âTm2O3âYb2O3 oxyfluoride glasses and glass ceramics was obtained, exciting at 1.0 Î¼m with a diode laser at room temperature. Transparent films and microspheres were prepared by a modified spin-coating technique. The effect of host composition on the up-conversion luminescence was studied in order to improve the ultraviolet radiation generation. In the glass samples, the Tm3+ blue (4786 Ã ) and red (6500 Ã ) visible emissions got more intense as the PbF2 content was increased. The main Tm3+ blue emission (4786 Ã , 1G4â3H6), results from a three-photon process. A second blue emission (4500 Ã , 1D2â3F4), followed by a UV emission (3650 and 3850 Ã , 1D2â3H6) was observed in the (2PbF2/GeO2) glass ceramics, in a narrow range of Al2O3 concentration. The 1D2 level of the Tm3+ ions is populated by a fourth photon from the cross-relaxation process given by (3F4,1G4)â(3H6,1D2).",1
"At high strains, randomly dispersed short glass fibre and glass particulate compounded in polypropylene, have shown higher flexure modulus than that of composites reinforced with either short glass fibre or glass particulate alone. The constant flexure stress independent of weight fractions of reinforcements due to the âhybrid effectâ has been observed in the present investigation.",0
"Novel transparent nano-glass-ceramics comprising RE-doped Sr2LuF7 nanocrystals have been obtained by thermal treatment of precursor solâgel glasses. The precipitated Sr2LuF7 nanocrystals with sizes from 4.5 to 11.5nm, confirmed by X-Ray Diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy images, show a cubic phase structure. The luminescent features of Eu3+ ions, used as structural probes, evidence the distribution of RE ions into the fluoride nanocrystals. Under 980nm laser excitation, intense UV, vis and NIR up-conversion emissions were observed and studied in Yb3+âTm3+, Yb3+âEr3+ and Yb3+âHo3+ co-doped nano-glass-ceramics. These results suggest considering these nano-glass-ceramics for potential optical applications as high efficient UV up-conversion materials in UV solid state lasers, infrared tuneable phosphors and photonic integrated devices.",1
"The glass-forming Ti75Zr10Si15 alloy is regarded as a potential material for implant applications due to its composition of non-toxic, biocompatible elements and some interesting mechanical properties. The effects of partial substitution of 15Â at.% Ti by Nb on the microstructure and the mechanical behaviour have been investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy and nanoindentation techniques. Copper mold casting and melt-spinning methods have been applied to study the influence of the cooling rate on the properties of both alloys, Ti75Zr10Si15 and Ti60Zr10Nb15Si15. As a result of different cooling rates, significant microstructural variations from multiphase crystalline states in cast rods to nanocomposite structures in ribbons were observed. The limited glass-forming ability (GFA) of the Ti75Zr10Si15 alloy results for melt-spun ribbons mainly in nanocomposite structures with Î²-type nanocrystals being embedded in a glassy matrix. Addition of Nb increases the glass-forming ability. Raising the overheating temperature of the melt prior to melt-spinning from 1923Â K to 2053Â K yields for both alloys a higher amorphous phase fraction. The mechanical properties were investigated using compression tests (bulk samples) and the nano-indentation technique. A decrease of hardness (H), ultimate stress and reduced Young's modulus (E r) is observed for Ti60Zr10Nb15Si15 rods as compared to Ti75Zr10Si15 ones. This is attributed to an increase of the fraction of the Î²-type phase. The melt-spun ribbons show an interesting combination of very high hardness values (H) and moderate reduced elastic modulus values (E r). This results in comparatively very high H/E r ratios of >0.075 which suggests these new materials for applications demanding high wear resistance.",0
"Dysprosium (Dy3+) ions doped oxy-fluoro boro tellurite glasses were prepared by using melt quenching technique to study their structural and optical properties using XRD, Raman, absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and PL decay spectral measurements. The XRD and Raman spectral patterns were used to confirm the glassy nature and various functional groups present in the prepared glasses respectively. The oscillator strengths measured from the absorption spectral features were used to evaluate the Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters. The PL spectra recorded under 386â¯nm excitation wavelength show two intense peaks; one in blue (485â¯nm) and the other one in yellow (576â¯nm) region corresponding to 4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H15/2 and 4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H13/2 transitions respectively. By correlating the J-O parameters with PL spectral data, various radiative properties like radiative transition probability (AR), stimulated emission cross section (Ïse) and branching ratios (Î²R) were evaluated for 4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H13/2 and 6H15/2 transitions. Using the PL decay spectral data the experimental lifetimes have been measured and in turn used to measure the quantum efficiency of the prepared glasses. The yellow to blue intensity ratio (Y/B) has been evaluated to understand the white light emission capacity of the host glass by changing the concentration of Dy3+ ions. In order to understand white light emission capacity of the prepared glasses, the CIE color co-ordinates have also been evaluated. From all the aforementioned studies, it is concluded that 1.0 mol% of Dy3+ ions doped oxy-fluoro boro tellurite glass is aptly suitable for optoelectronic device applications.",1
"Bulk amorphous Cu52.5Ti30Zr11.5Ni6 and Cu53.1Ti31.4Zr9.5Ni6 alloys with a high glass forming ability can be quenched into single amorphous rods with a diameter of 5 mm, and exhibit a high fracture strength of 2â212 MPa and 2â184 MPa under compressive condition, respectively. The stress â strain curves show nearly 2% elastic strain limit, yet display no appreciable macroscopic plastic deformation prior to the catastrophic fracture due to highly localized shear bands. The present work shows clearly evidence of molten droplets besides well-developed vein patterns typical of bulk metallic glasses on the fracture surface, suggesting that localized melting induced by adiabatic heating may occur during the final failure event.",0
"Delamination of a cross-ply 0/90 glass fibre-reinforced composite laminate with an epoxy-phenol matrix was studied using a double cantilever beam test. Fracture toughness was determined by measurement of bend angle of the cantilever beams. Results obtained with this method were in agreement with those from conventional compliance and area methods. Two different fracture modes were observed: interlaminar and intralaminar. In the interlaminar fracture mode, crack jumps in the space between two neighbouring 0Â° and 90Â° plies were observed. With the interlaminar fracture mode, during crack initiation G Ic decreased with crack length. Intralaminar fracture mode consisted of the gradual growth of a crack through a 0Â° ply. Fibres bridging the opposite sides of the crack were observed in this case, and fracture toughness G Ic did not change with crack length. G Ic (420 J mâ2) at intralaminar fracture mode was approximately twice that at interlaminar fracture mode (220 J mâ2). The difference in fracture toughness was explained by the dissipation of energy by fibres bridging the opposite sides of the crack at intralaminar fracture mode.",0
"A three-dimensional (3D) continuous and interconnected network graphene foam (GF) was synthesized by chemical vapor deposition using nickel foam as a template. The morphologies of the GF were observed by scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the structure of GF. The graphene with few layers and defect free was closely coated on the backbone of the 3D nickel foam. After etching nickel, the GF was transferred onto indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, which acted as an electrode to detect uric acid using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The GF/ITO electrode showed a high sensitivity for the detection of uric acid: approximately 9.44Â mAÂ mMâ1 in the range of 25Â nMâ0.1Â Î¼M and 1.85Â mAÂ mMâ1 in the range of 0.1â60Â Î¼M. The limit of detection of GF/ITO electrode for uric acid is 3Â nM. The GF/ITO electrode also showed a high selectivity for the detection of uric acid in the presence of ascorbic acid. This electrode will have a wide range of potential application prospects in electrochemical detection.",0
"The crystallization kinetics of Se80Te20âx Zn x with x =0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 chalcogenide glasses were investigated using non-isothermal crystallization approach. The glass transition temperature (T g ) and crystallization temperature (T c ) of these glasses were determined using the differential scanning calorimeter at different heating rates. The dependence of T g and T c on the heating rate (Î²) has been used for the determination of the activation energy of crystallization (E c), the activation energy of structural relaxation (E t), crystallization enthalpy (ÎH c) and the Avrami exponent (n). It was found that the enthalpy released is minimum at 2.5% of Zn, hence, the glass with 2.5% of Zn is most stable in the Se80Te20âx Zn x system. The crystallization kinetics for the glasses was studied by using the modified Kissinger and Ozawa equations.",1
"Formation of FeâCâSiâBâPâ(CrâAlâCo) bulk metallic glasses with enhanced glass-forming ability (GFA) and magnetic properties fabricated using industrial pig-iron and FeâP alloys as raw materials has been studied. It was found that GFA of the pig-iron (Fe79.5C18.0Si2.3P0.2, at%) could be improved by proper additions of only metalloids C, Si, P and B, and fully glassy structure was obtained in the Fe75.5C7.0Si3.3B5.5P8.7 alloy with a critical diameter of 1mm. With suitable additions of metallic elements Cr, Co and Al, the GFA is further increased and fully amorphous rods in 4mm diameter can be prepared for the Fe68.2C7.0Si3.3B5.5P8.7Cr2.3Al2.0Co3.0 alloy that shows a unique combination of good soft-magnetic properties (M s=1.03T, H c=9.39A/m), high GFA and high fracture strength. These low-cost Fe-based bulk metallic glasses fabricated using industrial raw materials have a potential to be utilized as engineering materials.",0
"Magnetic, thermal and electrical properties of the Y0.95Sc0.05(Mn1âx Al x )2 pseudo-binary system have been studied. The ground state of Y0.95Sc0.05Mn2 is paramagnetic with quantum spin fluctuations of large amplitude. By substituting Al for Mn, x âT curves exhibit a maximum due to a spin glass freezing and the enhanced Î³ value for x = 0 decreases rapidly with x. These observations are interpreted as a result of the spin liquid to spin glass transition by impurity effects in a frustrated system.",0
"Bulk magnetic Fe80â x Mo x P13C7 (x =0, 3, 6, 9 and 12at.%) glassy alloys were successfully prepared by the fluxing technique and J-quenching technique. The effect of Mo substitution for Fe on the glass formation ability (GFA), thermal stability, mechanical properties and magnetic properties has been studied systematically. It was found that the substitution of a small amount of Mo for Fe can dramatically enhance the GFA, which in turn, the critical maximum diameter for fully glass formation reached to 5.5mm for x =3 and 6.0mm for x =6, respectively. However, excessive substitution will promote the formation of Fe2Mo3 competition crystalline phase leading to the degradation of the GFA. Furthermore, the substitution of proper content of Mo for Fe can obviously enhance the mechanical properties of the present Fe-based alloys, which can be identified that the current FeMoPC bulk metallic glass possesses a high fracture strength (over 3000MPa) as well as a large room temperature plasticity (above 5%). In addition, the Mo doping FePC bulk metallic glasses exhibit good soft magnetic properties with a relatively high saturation magnetization of over 1.0T at room temperature.",0
"We present the optical properties such as the linear refractive index (n), the absorption coefficient (Î±), the energy band gap (E g ) and the nonlinear refractive index (n 2) measured by spectroscopy and degenerate four wave mixing methods for Er3+-doped oxyfluoride glasses and nano-glass-ceramics. The n 2 of the Er3+-doped oxyfluoride nano-glass-ceramic is almost twice that of the Er3+-doped parent oxyfluoride glass and undoped oxyfluoride glass. The n 2 values of the Er3+-doped oxyfluoride glass and non-Er3+-doped oxyfluoride glass are almost the same.",0
"Rare earth doped oxyfluoroborate glasses have been prepared with different concentration of Eu3+. The UV-Vis/NIR optical absorption, laser induced fluorescence and photoacoustic spectra of Eu3+ in this host have been studied. Different optical parameters such as oscillator strength, JuddâOfelt intensity parameter, stimulated emission cross-section, transition probability, branching ratio and radiative lifetime, etc. have been calculated. Lifetime of the 5 D 0 level at various concentrations of Eu3+ have been used to explain the concentration dependent fluorescence quenching. The mechanism of quenching was found to be dipoleâdipole. Energy transfer have also been studied from Eu3+ to Pr3+ in sample with 1mol% Eu3+ + 1mol% Pr3+.",1
"This study examined the contribution of hygroscopic expansion of glass-ionomer (GIC) and resin modified glass-ionomer (RMGIC) luting cements to the push-out resistance of fiber posts. Glass fiber posts were luted to post spaces using different cements. Experimental specimens were stored in water, while control specimens were desiccated and stored in mineral oil to eliminate water from intraradicular dentinal tubules and/or the external environment that could have contributed to hygroscopic expansion of the cements. Thin slice push-out tests revealed no difference in retention strengths of resin composite cements that were stored in water or oil. Conversely, GIC and RMGIC cements exhibited increased retention strengths after water sorption. As unfavorable cavity geometry is taxing to dentin bond integrity in root canals, a strategy that relies on increasing the frictional resistance to post dislodgement via delayed hygroscopic expansion of glass-ionomer based materials may be a more pragmatic approach to fiber post retention.",0
Zero-field muon spin relaxation measurements have been performed on uniaxially anisotropic spin-glass ZnMn with 270 and 600 ppm Mn. Anomalies in the temperature dependence of the relaxation have been observed in each sample. These behaviors are considered to be an indication of the two successive transitions in the anisotropic spin-glass suggested by recent susceptibility measurements.,0
The magnetic properties of amorphous (FexNi100âx)75P16B6Al3 have been investigated in the critical concentration region (x c â 17) via neutron scattering. For x > x c a transition to ferromagnetism is first observed followed at lower temperatures by an evolution to spin-glass behavior. Associated with this low temperature state are two distinct time scales corresponding to a resolution-limited elastic peak and to excitations. The temperature dependence of the elastic component is directly related to the spin-glass order parameter and indicates that there is a region of temperature where ferromagnetism and spin-glass order coexist.,0
"Spectroscopic properties of various concentrations Dy3+-doped silicate glasses were characterized by excitation and emission spectra. The optimal doping concentration of Dy3+ ions was found to be 3.0wt%, and the nature of resonance energy transfer was confirmed to be electric dipoleâdipole interaction according to Huangâs rule. Simulation of white-light for these glasses was also performed by varying the excitation wavelength. The results show that the white-light luminescence color could be tuned to various wavelength excitations, and the present silicate glass is more suitable for generation of white-light for blue LED chips.",1
"Glass formation in the K2OâTiO2âP2O5âSiO2 system, and the structure and crystallization behavior of glasses having compositions near the stoichiometry of KTiOPO4 (KTP) have been examined by differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fast Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and second harmonic generation (SHG). Pure glasses may be obtained adding an appropriate amount of P2O5 as well as of SiO2 to the KTP composition. Transparent and homogeneous glasses were synthesized for the 56(K2OÂ·2TiO2Â·P2O5)Â·44P2O5 (KTPâ44P) and the 90(K2OÂ·2TiO2Â·P2O5)Â·10SiO2 (KTPâ10Si) molar compositions. In contrast, for the 80(K2OÂ·2TiO2Â·P2O5)Â·20SiO2 (KTPâ20Si) and for higher SiO2 contents, the obtained glasses were partially opaque and phase separated. KTP glasses with lower P2O5 content cannot be obtained as they crystallize during quenching. The KTPâ10Si glass shows the only exothermic peak connected to KTP phase crystallization whereas the KTPâ44P and the KTPâ20Si glasses devitrify in two steps. Firstly the same unidentified phase is formed in both these glasses and the KTP phase is formed only at higher temperatures. Transparent and opalescent KTP glasses exhibiting SHG activity may be produced by careful heat treatments at temperatures just above T g. The origin of SHG in transparent glasses is supposed to be connected with either precipitation of KTiOPO4 nanocrystallites or very early stages of liquid-type phase separation.",1
"Statement of problem The effect of different surface treatment techniques on the bond strength of different types of ceramic-glass polymer computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials and resin cements after aging is unknown. Purpose The purpose of this inÂ vitro study was to evaluate the surface roughness of different ceramic-glass polymer CAD-CAM materials after 2 different surface treatments and the effect of material, surface treatment, resin cement, and aging on bond strength. Additionally, it was to determine any correlation between the surface roughness and bond strength. Material and methods CAD-CAM ceramic-glass polymer materials, a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) (VITA ENAMIC), a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate), and a nanoparticle-filled resin (Cerasmart) (1.5 mm in thickness; n=144) were divided into 2 subgroups in terms of surface treatments: airborne-particle abraded or silica-coated. The surface roughness values of specimens were measured. Composite resin cylinders were prepared and bonded to the restorative specimens using 2 different types of resin cements (dual-polymerizing [DP] and light-polymerizing [LP]). Half of the specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 hours, while the other half were submitted to 5000 thermocycles. The shear bond strength was measured, and the failure modes of the specimens were evaluated. The data were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests (Î±=.05). The correlation between roughness and bond strength values was analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. Results Material (P=.012) and surface treatment type (P=.031) significantly affected the surface roughness. For bond strength, significant interactions were found among the material type, surface treatment, resin cement, and aging factors (P=.009). No significant correlation was found between roughness and bond strength (P=.943). Conclusions The surface treatment and resin cement type affected the bond strength and surface roughness of tested restorative materials. DP resin cement provided higher bond strength for airborne-particle abraded nanohybrid composite resin materials. LP resin cement achieved a higher bond strength when used with silica-coated, nanoparticle-filled resin and PICN materials.",0
"Proton conducting ionic glasses which consist of only isolated ions were successfully prepared from only CsHSO4 and the mixture of CsHSO4 and CsH2PO4 by melt-quenching technique. The 50CsHSO4Â·50CsH2PO4 glass showed the conductivity of 4.2Ã10â6 S cmâ1 at room temperature. The 50CsHSO4Â·50CsH2PO4 glass exhibited much higher ionic conductivity than CsHSO4 and Cs2(HSO4)(H2PO4) crystals in a relatively wide temperature range of ambient to 90Â°C under dry Ar atmosphere, indicating that vitrification of CsHSO4-based solid acids is effective in enhancing their conductivity.",1
"0.4 Er3+-doped 90.7 SiO2 â 4.4 P2O5 â 2.3 HfO2 â 1.7 Al2O3 â 0.7 Na2O planar waveguide was fabricated by multi-target rf-sputtering technique starting by massive Er3+-activated P2O5-SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O glass. The optical parameters were measured by m-line apparatus operating at 632.8, 1319 and 1542Â nm. The waveguide compositions were investigated by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy and its morphology analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy. The waveguide exhibits a single propagation mode at 1319 and 1542Â nm with an attenuation coefficient of 0.2Â dB/cm in the infrared. The emission of 4I13/2Â âÂ 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ion, with a 28.5Â nm bandwidth was observed upon TE0 mode excitation at 514.5Â nm. The optical and spectroscopic features of the Er3+-activated parent P2O5-SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O glass were also investigated.",1
"The competition among spin glass (SG), antiferromagnetism (AF) and local pairing superconductivity (PAIR) is studied in a two-sublattice fermionic Ising SG model with a local BCS pairing interaction in the presence of a transverse magnetic field Î . The spins in different sublattices interact with Gaussian random couplings with an antiferromagnetic mean. The problem is formulated in a Grassmann path integral formalism. The static ansatz and the replica symmetry are used to obtain the half-filling thermodynamic potential. The results are shown in phase diagrams that exhibit a complex transition line separating the PAIR phase from the others. This line is second order at high temperature which ends in a tricritical point. The presence of Î affects deeply the transition lines.",0
"A series of Cu+/Eu3+ co-doped borosilicate glasses have been successfully prepared by melt-quenching method. As proved by transmission spectra, the copper ions are univalent in the investigated borosilicate glasses. Under ultraviolet (UV) excitation at 325â¯nm, the emission intensity of Eu3+ increased by nearly double due to a large overlapping between the Cu+ and Eu3+ emission peaks. The decreased excitation intensity in UV region and shortened emission lifetime of Cu+ in association with presence of Eu3+ ions consistently suggest an energy transfer process from Cu+ to Eu3+ ions. On the other hand, the partially allowed transition of Cu+ makes contribution to the red emission of Eu3+ at 611â¯nm in Cu+/Eu3+ co-doped samples, thus shortening the lifetime from the conventional millisecond (â¼1.86â¯ms) to the microsecond (up to around 37â¯Î¼s) regime. Besides, tunable light is realized by combining the blue-green emission from Cu+ ions with the orange-red one from Eu3+ ions. The light can be continuously tuned by changing the Cu+/Eu3+ concentration ratio, indicating that the present novel Cu+/Eu3+ co-doped borosilicate glasses are potential as fast response and tunable photoluminescence materials.",1
"The elastic properties of propylene glycol (PG) were studied by Brillouin scattering between 100K and 442K using a high-resolution FabryâPerot interferometer. The acoustic phonon velocity, phonon damping, and relaxation time were measured as functions of temperature. At high temperatures, the temperature dependence of the relaxation time obeyed the Arrhenius law, Ï = Ï 0 exp(ÎE/k B T). We obtained ÎE =0.27eV and Ï 0 =6.40Ã10â16 s. The dynamical properties between racemic PG and chiral isomer (S)-PG were compared and small differences, which were within the experimental uncertainty, were observed. These differences were attributed to the molecular interaction, which played an important role in relaxation. Neither material displayed an elastic anomaly at its melting point.",0
"Light-cured glass ionomers with an initial set of 20 seconds may produce higher initial bond strengths, as well as decreased sensitivity to moisture contamination and desiccation, than chemically cured glass ionomers making them attractive for use as orthodontic bonding agents. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the shear bond strength of stainless steel orthodontic attachments to enamel with a light-cured glass ionomer (Zionomer) tested at 60 minutes and 24 hours, and a rapidly setting chemically cured glass ionomer (Ketac-Bond) tested at 60 minutes and 24 hours. Fifty-two recently extracted human premolars were randomly divided into four groupsâ1-hour and 24-hour light-cured glass ionomer groups and 1-hour and 24-hour chemically cured glass ionomer groups. Stainless steel lingual buttons were bonded to prepared enamel surfaces, and the samples were placed in a water bath at 37Â° C until ready for testing. The shear bond strength of each sample was determined with a universal testing instrument. Results from the study conclude: (1) The mean shear bond strength of the light-cured glass ionomer is greater than that of the chemically cured glass ionomer at 1 and 24 hours. (2) The mean shear bond strength of both glass ionomers increases from 1 to 24 hours. (3) The mean shear bond strength of the lightcured glass ionomer is not significantly different from 1 to 24 hours, but the shear bond strength of the chemically cured glass ionomer cement is different. The faster setting reaction of the light-cured glass ionomer and its higher initial and sustained bond strength make it more attractive for use as an orthodontic bonding agent.",0
"Glasses in the LMAS (Li2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2) system containing F, CaO, ZrO2, and TiO2 were subjected to crystallization by incorporating P2O5. The glass stability, glass forming ability, and crystallization kinetics have been determined. Crystals of Lithium Aluminum Silicate (Li x Al x Si1âx O2), Enstatite (MgSi2O6) and Î²-spodumene (LiAlSi2O6) were detected in the samples containing F, but Î²-spodumene was not observed in the glass-ceramic in its absence. Glasses containing F show a dependence of the activation with the addition of P2O5 with energy values ranging from 426kJmolâ1 to 483kJmolâ1, being this maximum found for P2O5 amounts up to 3mol%. High concentrations of P2O5 and Al2O3 improve the glass stability and increase the crystallization temperature. The most common crystallization mechanism is of bulk type with a constant number of nuclei. Two- and three-dimensional growth of crystals was observed in glasses containing F but in its absence and at high Al2O3 concentration bulk crystallization with two- and one-dimensional growth is observed.",1
The vinylester resin around a silane-finished glass fibre was measured using a microscopic FTi.r. spectrometer. It is argued that the silane affected the curing process of the vinylester resin at a great distance compared to the thickness of the silane interphase.,0
"Glass with the composition of SiO2-GeO2-CaCO3-Li2CO3-Nb2O5-BaO-Tm2O3 has been prepared and its characteristic temperatures have been measured. ÎT (155Â°C) of the glass indicates it has good thermal stability. A broadband emission spectrum around 2Âµm with full-width at half-maximum close to 237nm has been obtained, which suggests this germanosilicate glass is a competitive candidate for the ultrashort pulse generation as few broadband emission realized by Tm3+ single-doping. The calculated maximum of absorption cross section and emission cross section of the transition Tm3+:3F4â3H6 was 3.31Ã10â21 cm2 at 1654nm and 6.88Ã10â21 cm2 at 1870nm, respectively. Besides, the energy transfer mechanism of 2Âµm fluorescence behaviors was analyzed theoretically and quantitatively. The energy transfer coefficient CD-A of cross relaxation process of Tm3+ ions was 10.9Ã10â40 cm6/s in SGT glass. These results indicate that the prepared glass may have promising application in 2Âµm fluorescence.",1
Fully dense amorphous Al86Ni6Y4.5Co2La1.5 alloy with a 10mm diameter has been fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS). It showed record fracture strength of 1250MPa for aluminium alloys. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed good interfacial bonding. The activation energy for the SPS process depends on the applied pressure and is substantially higher than that for the self-diffusion of aluminium.,0
"Broadband infrared luminescence is observed in various Bi-doped oxide glasses prepared by conventional melting-quenching technique. The absorption spectrum of the Bi-doped germanium oxide glass consists of five broad peaks at below 370, 500, 700, 800 and 1000nm. The fluorescence spectrum exhibits a broad peak at about 1300nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of more than 300nm when excited by an 808nm laser diode. The fluorescence lifetime at room temperature decreases with increasing Bi2O3 concentration. Influence of the glass composition and melting atmosphere on the fluorescence lifetime and luminescent intensity is investigated. The mechanism of the broadband infrared luminescence is suggested. The product of stimulated emission cross-section and lifetime of the Bi-doped aluminophosphate glass is about 5.0Ã10â24 cm2 s. The glasses might be promising for applications in broadband optical fiber amplifiers and tunable lasers.",1
"RÃ©sumÃ© Une femme de 54 ans a Ã©tÃ© admise en rÃ©animation pour intoxication mÃ©dicamenteuse volontaire au zolipidem (StilnoxÂ®), au dimenhydrinate (MercalmÂ®), et Ã lâÅstradiol 17 bÃªta (OromoneÂ®). La scanographie cÃ©rÃ©brale rÃ©alisÃ©e devant des signes cliniques Ã©vocateurs de souffrance cÃ©rÃ©brale montrait de multiples zones dâischÃ©mie tÃ©moignant dâinfarctus cÃ©rÃ©braux rÃ©cents. Une Ã©chographie transÅsophagienne pratiquÃ©e 12 heures aprÃ¨s mettait en Ã©vidence la prÃ©sence dâun thrombus mobile de la crosse de lâaorte, sans lÃ©sions athÃ©romateuses. Une ischÃ©mie du membre supÃ©rieur droit est apparue secondairement, probablement consÃ©cutive Ã un embole issu du thrombus aortique. La patiente est dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©e au troisiÃ¨me jour suite Ã lâaggravation de lâischÃ©mie cÃ©rÃ©brale. Ce cas clinique rappelle que le diagnostic dâintoxication mÃ©dicamenteuse doit rester un diagnostic dâÃ©limination et que la thrombose de la crosse de lâaorte, pathologie rare en rÃ©animation, doit Ãªtre Ã©voquÃ©e de principe devant un infarctus cÃ©rÃ©bral si lâon suspecte des emboles dâorigine artÃ©rielle. A 54-year-old patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for voluntary drug intoxication with zolipidem (StilnoxÂ®), dimenhydrinate (MercalmÂ®), and Åstradiol 17 beta (OromoneÂ®). Four hours after the admission the patient was comatose. Cerebral computerized tomodensitometry demonstrated multiple zones of ischaemia. Transoesophageal echocardiography was performed 12 hours after the arrival of the patient and revealed a mobile thrombus of the aortic arch. The remainder of the visualized aortic arch did not present atherosclerotic plaque. Secondarily, ischaemia of the right superior limb was diagnosed probably cause by emboli originating in the aortic thrombus appeared. The patient died three days later after her arrival, because of neurologic sequelae of the cerebral embolic events. This clinical case underlines the concept that the diagnosis of drug intoxication must remain a diagnosis of elimination. The thrombosis of the aortic arch is a rare pathology in intensive care units. In the presence of unexplained ischaemic stroke and an peripheral emboli, the thrombosis of the aortic arch should be suspected.",0
"This paper reports on cooperative energy transfer and upconversion luminescence properties of Tb3+/Yb3+- and Nd3+/Yb3+/Tb3+-codoped oxyfluoride glasses. Upon excitation with a 980nm laser diode, an intense green upconversion luminescence along with weak ultraviolet (UV)âvisible emissions has been observed in Yb3+/Tb3+-codoped oxyfluoride glasses. Power dependence of UVâvisible upconversion luminescence intensity has been examined, revealing that a cooperative energy transfer mechanism from Yb3+ ions is responsible for the excitation of Tb3+ ions. Meanwhile, it is noticed that Tb3+ upconversion emission bands have also been clearly detected at 487, 542, 587 and 620nm in Nd3+/Yb3+/Tb3+-codoped oxyfluoride glasses upon excitation with a 808nm laser diode. The quadratic dependence of the upconversion luminescence on the pump-laser power indicates two-photon process for the population of Tb3+:5D4 state via Nd3+âYb3+âTb3+ energy transfer. However, no emission has been observed in the oxyfluoride glasses codoped with Yb3+/Tb3+ or Nd3+/Tb3+, respectively, upon excited at a 808nm laser diode. A proposed upconversion mechanism involving energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+, and then a cooperative energy transfer process from two excited Yb3+ to Tb3+ has been presented.",1
"Introduction Le pyoderma gangrenosum est une maladie neutrophilique dont lâatteinte la plus caractÃ©ristique est lâulcÃ©ration cutanÃ©e. Les atteintes viscÃ©rales sont plus raresÂ ; les plus dÃ©crites Ã©tant lâatteinte pulmonaire et splÃ©nique. Nous rapportons un cas dâatteinte oculaire de pyoderma gangrenosum. Observations Il sâagit dâune patiente de 70ans sans antÃ©cÃ©dent notable ni traitement au long cours. Elle prÃ©sentait en 2006 un abcÃ¨s pulmonaire lobaire supÃ©rieur droit dont lâensemble du bilan Ã©tiologique Ã©tait nÃ©gatif. Le traitement par antibiothÃ©rapie adaptÃ©e prolongÃ©e ne permettait pas dâamÃ©lioration clinique. Une lobectomie Ã©tait rÃ©alisÃ©e. Les prÃ©lÃ¨vements microbiologiques Ã©taient nÃ©gatifs. Lâanatomopathologie montrait un infiltrat inflammatoire Ã polynuclÃ©aires neutrophiles. Les suites opÃ©ratoires se compliquaient de lâapparition dâune vaste ulcÃ©ration superficielle au niveau de la cicatrice de thoracotomie de 30Ã8cm douloureuse. Lâensemble du bilan rÃ©alisÃ© Ã©tait normal. Lâanatomopathologie montrait une ulcÃ©ration avec un infiltrat de polynuclÃ©aires neutrophiles sans image de vascularite associÃ©e. Le diagnostic de pyoderma gangrenosum avec atteinte cutanÃ©e et pulmonaire Ã©tait posÃ©. Plusieurs lignes thÃ©rapeutiques ont Ã©tÃ© nÃ©cessaires Ã la cicatrisation complÃ¨te des lÃ©sions en 2009Â : corticothÃ©rapie gÃ©nÃ©rale, association Ã la ciclosporine puis Ã un anti-TNFÎ±Â : lâinfliximab.

"The tungsten alloys reinforced by ZrO2 were prepared using azeotropic distillation method combined with powder metallurgy method, and then the sintered tungsten alloys were swaged to obtain compact bars. The microstructures of W-xZrO2 (xâ¯=â¯0, 0.25, 1.0 and 1.5â¯wt%) alloys were investigated by means of SEM, XRD and TEM. The results show that ZrO2 exist as a stable cubic phase in tungsten alloys by adding Y2O3. Fine ZrO2 particles (500â800â¯nm) are dispersed in the tungsten matrix, and thus refine the grain size and improve the physical properties and strength of tungsten alloys. With the increase of the ZrO2 content, the relative density, hardness and compressive strength of tungsten alloys were all increased. The swaged Wâ1.5â¯wt%ZrO2 alloy shows the finest microstructure with an average grain size of 47.18â¯Î¼m, reducing 34.76% compared with that of pure tungsten. And thus, the swaged Wâ1.5â¯wt%ZrO2 alloy achieves the highest compressive strength (1941.3â¯MPa) and failure strain (23.1%) at the same time, increasing 23.27% and 22.37%, respectively, compared with that of pure tungsten.",0
"The effect of Mo addition on the glass-forming ability (GFA), magnetic properties, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of (Fe0.76Si0.096B0.084P0.06)100âx Mo x (x =0, 2, 4 and 6at.%) bulk glassy alloys (BGAs) with high Fe contents was investigated. The 2at.% Mo addition makes the alloy composition approach towards a eutectic point, which could result in an increase in the GFA. The BGA rod with diameters up to 3.5mm was produced by copper mold casting. These BGAs exhibit a rather high saturation magnetization of 0.98â1.51T and lower coercive force of 1.7â2.1A/m. A significant improvement in corrosion resistance was observed with microalloying Mo element in 1N H2SO4 solution. Furthermore, these Fe-based BGAs show super-high strength of â¼3.3GPa and Young's modulus of 200GPa.",0
"We report monolithic and transparent phosphosilicate membranes (PSMs) for high proton conduction. The membrane material was derived from the solâgel precursors of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4), which were subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 150Â°C for 30h. The obtained PSMs exhibited proton conductivities of up to 10â1 Scmâ1, which is comparable to those of available commercial membranes, such as a NafionÂ® membrane. The unique hydrothermal treatment that we employed and the utilization of H3PO4 as raw material are believed to be responsible for the high proton conduction of the resulting PSMs.",0
"In this study, laser shock peening (LSP) has been performed on brick-shaped Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 (vit1) bulk metallic glass (BMG) with different dimensions but the same aspect ratio of 2:1 to study the effects of LSP treatment and size-dependence on plasticity and compressive strength at room temperature. The results show that: (1) the plasticity of LSP treated specimens is still size-dependent, the smaller the specimen size is, the higher plasticity and compressive strength it has, which means the size effects of BMG can be preserved and inherited during LSP. (2) The same LSP treatment has different effects on different size specimens, the smaller the specimen size is, the greater effect it has, which indicates that LSP process causes much more obvious size-dependence in BMG. The mechanism for plasticity improvement can be attributed to the increase of free volume and the generation of deep compressive residual stress induced by LSP for each size specimen. Therefore, smaller specimen is corresponding with larger volume fraction of LSP affected zones and greater LSP effect.",0
"The metallic rare-earth systems presenting strongly correlated electron properties are characterised by the existence of a strong 4f-conduction band hybridisation and, usually, by a non-negligible long-range magnetic interaction (RKKY type). In addition, other effects such as crystalline electric field or disorder contribute to the rich phenomenology found in these compounds. The actual interest is focussed on the compounds where the magnetic order is suppressed at a given critical pressure P C or, in the case of induced chemical pressure, at a critical concentration x C. In this region, corresponding to a zero temperature phase transition, non-Fermi liquid behaviour on the specific heat, resistivity or susceptibility has been found. The first part of this article will be devoted to analyse the mentioned magnetic interactions and to describe the role of the different implied parameters (cell volume, number of electrons, etc). In the second part, we present the CeNi1âx Cu x system as an example of the interplay of the mentioned interactions leading to the disappearance of the long-range order. The spin-glass-like phase appearing in this system is discussed considering recent data, which confirm the existence of a cluster-glass behaviour. The effects of sample annealing are also discussed close to the magnetic non-magnetic crossover point.",0
"The environmental concerns related to the production of cement in terms of the energy consumption and the emission of CO2 lead to the search for more environmentally viable alternatives to cement. One of those alternative materials is ground granulated blast-furnace slag is used not only as a partial replacement to cement but also as the sole binder in the form of alkali-activated slag (AAS) to produce concrete. In addition to a control OPC mix, an OPC/slag mix with 60% cement replacement by GGBS, and also AAS mixes were prepared with slag as the sole binder, activated with water glass at two dosages, 4% and 6% Na2O (by weight of slag). Two types of water glass were used, one in a solution form and the other in a solid granules form. The two forms of the activator used were also of different silicate modulus (M s); 1.65 for the solution form and 1.0 for the granule form. All the mixes had the same binder content and w/b=0.48. This paper presents the results of the durability related tests that were carried out which included, chloride penetration resistance, porosity, carbonation, and alkaliâsilica reaction. The effect of the different parameters including the activator type and dosage are discussed. The results give indications on the good durability of alkali-activated slag concrete compared to conventional OPC concrete.",0
"Rare-earth (Er,Yb) doped glass films are prepared by pulsed laser deposition onto different substrates: Si, fused quartz and Si with a silicon oxide buffer layer. Films grown in the presence of an oxygen pressure higher than6 Ã 10â2 mbar have a refractive index close and slightly higher than that of the bulk material thus proving that the density of the films is high. Films thicker than 1 Î¼m are multimode waveguides with a refractive index of1.562Â±0.003 and show losses higher than 10 dB/cm which seem to be related to surface roughness due both to the substrate quality and the deposition process.",0
Hot photoluminescence and its polarization memory were observed at room temperature in a-As2S3 and a-GeSe2. The hot photoluminescence was interpreted with the Franck-Condon principle as well as the steady-state photoluminescence.,1
"Strontium aluminoborate glasses with different concentrations of Ce (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5mol%) were synthesized by the conventional melt-quenching technique. After the synthesis, photoluminescence (PL), scintillation and dosimetric properties of the samples were evaluated systematically. In the photoluminescence and scintillation spectra, a sharp peak around 370nm due to the 5d-4f transitions of Ce was observed. The 0.05% Ce-doped sample showed the highest intensity in PL and scintillation among the samples investigated. The 0.01â0.1% Ce-doped samples also showed thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) with a glow peak of around 90Â°C after X-ray irradiation. The TSL response of 0.01â0.05% Ce-doped samples increased monotonically with X-ray dose over a dose range of 10â1â104 mGy.",1
"The equilibrium behaviour of linear dynamical susceptibility is investigated in terms of quantum Ising spin glass droplet model. The imaginary part of linear ac susceptibility Ïâ³(Ï,T) as function of temperature T and frequency of external ac field Ï is analytically calculated on the basis of the linear dynamical response theory. It is found that such dependence of Ïâ³(Ï,T) shows a glassy behaviour. A qualitative agreement with experimental data, for example, in quantum dipole magnet LiHo x Y1âx F4 and proton glass is found.",0
Erbium-doped tellurite glasses (TeO2âZnOâNa2O3: Er3+ (TZNE)) were elaborated from the melt-quenching method. Various spectroscopic parameters were obtained to evaluate their dependence and the potential of the samples as a laser material in the eye-safe laser wavelength (1.53Î¼m) as a function of the Er3+ concentration. The dependence of infrared photoluminescence (PL) spectra on doping concentration shows a quenching of the PL intensity for Er3+ concentration above 2mol%. Such dependence is discussed in terms of interactions between Er3+ ions and OHâ content. FTIR spectra were measured in order to calculate the exact content of OHâ groups in samples. It was found that PL quenching with Er concentration in the tellurite glass is independent of OHâ content. Stimulated cross-section at 1.53Î¼m was determined and was discussed using the McCumber theory.,1
Microcavity excitonâpolaritons within GaN-based structures are the object of the present work. The impact of the structural imperfections on the properties of the two-dimensional polariton gas is investigated through the calculation of its phase diagram. We demonstrate that the presence of disorder first induces a quasi-phase transition of the polariton system towards a Bose-glass phase before it becomes superfluid as its density increases. Calculations of the density of states as well as the condensate wavefunction and the related spectrum of elementary excitations in the framework of the GrossâPitaevskii theory provide further insight into the properties of excitonâpolaritons in GaN-based microcavities.,0
"Improving the lasing emission property of rare-earth doped vitreous material is a research topic. In this paper, Er3+/Yb3+/Tm3+ tri-doped tellurite glasses with and without WO3 component were synthesized using melt-quenching technique and the effect of WO3 addition on the 1.80Â Î¼m band fluorescence of Tm3+ was investigated. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) curve, Raman spectrum, UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectrum, near-infrared emission spectrum and fluorescence decay curve. The XRD pattern confirmed amorphous structural nature of synthesized tellurite glass, the DSC curve revealed good thermal stability with Î T >100Â Â°C and the Raman spectrum displayed a stretching vibration band around 920Â cmâ1 for glass host with WO3. Under the excitation of 980Â nm laser diode (LD), the intense 1.80Â Î¼m band fluorescence of Tm3+ originated from the 3F4â3H6 transition was observed in the Er3+/Yb3+/Tm3+ tri-doped tellurite glass and the intensity increases further with the addition of a certain amount of WO3, which is attributed to the enhanced energy transfers from Yb3+ (Er3+) to Tm3+ ions due to the increased phonon energy of glass host. The energy transfer mechanism between them was elucidated by analyzing fluorescence decay behavior of Tm3+ and quantitatively calculating energy transfer coefficient as well as phonon contribution ratio. Meanwhile, based on the absorption spectrum, some important spectroscopic parameters such as Judd-Ofelt parameter, spontaneous radiative transition probability, fluorescence branching ratio, absorption and emission cross-sections, and gain coefficient spectrum were calculated to reveal spectroscopic properties of doped Tm3+ ions. The obtained results indicate that Er3+/Yb3+/Tm3+ tri-doped tellurite glass with an appropriate amount of WO3 is a promising gain medium applied for the 1.80Â Î¼m band solid-state lasers.",1
"The growth of GaN and some In x Ga1âx N films on conventional glass substrates using RF plasma excitation is investigated. Highly c-axis oriented films are obtained at low growth temperatures, and the crystallinity depends on the growth rate as well as the growth temperature. The resistivity of the films can be adjusted by controlling the growth rate, the RF power and the In content. The use of thin GaN buffer layers decreases the resistivity of the GaN films considerably.",0
"A new coupling technique for glass-metal joining was presented in this paper. Firstly, the glass and Al were successfully bonded by anodic bonding process, then the joining between Al and Cu was achieved by soldering with eutectic Sn-9Zn solder. The microstructures of glass/Al interface and solder joint were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and the interface evolution mechanism as well as the correlation between the glass/Cu joining strength and the interface morphology were discussed. The results showed that a sodium-depleted layer with a thickness of 546â¯nm was formed on the glass/Al interface at 400â¯Â°C/1000â¯V. Al-Sn-Zn solid solution, Cu5Zn8 and CuZn5 reaction layers were detected on Al/solder interface and Cu/solder interface respectively. As the soldering time increased, needle-like (Al)' phases and round (Al)'' phases were observed in sequence near Al/solder interface; at the same time, the thickness of Cu5Zn8 and CuZn5 layers increased accordingly. When the soldering time was 10â¯min, micro grooves on Al foil were observed, and CuZn5 IMCs spalled off and dispersed into liquid solder, which deteriorated the joint strength. During the soldering process, the whole interface evolution could be divided into four stages and was analyzed explicitly. Shear tests indicated the fracture mainly occurred at solder/Cu interface and a small amount of Al foil was torn off the glass substrate when soldering time exceeded 5â¯min. The shear strength increased at first and then reduced with the prolongation of soldering time, and the maximum strength was 12.7â¯MPa when the joint was achieved at 240â¯Â°C for 5â¯min.",0
"Tailoring the properties of an engineering material with low coefficient of friction (COF) and high wear resistance has been a long goal in the tribological research. It is particularly true for the bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs), which are promising for a large range of advanced applications. Although the materials design and mechanical properties have been extensively investigated, knowledge of their tribological behaviors is still lacking. Ball-on-block wear tests were thus conducted to investigate the effect of Sn addition on the tribological behaviors of Ti45Zr25Nb6Cu5Be17 BMGCs under different normal loads. Nano-indentation and nano-scratch tests were carried out to study the phase-specific wear properties of the crystalline dendrite and amorphous matrix in BMGCs respectively. Preferred wear and delamination in the dendrite phase as a result of the plastic mismatch between the two constituent phases is responsible for the abrasive wear in the Ti47Zr25Nb6Cu5Be17 and Ti46Zr25Nb6Cu5Be17Sn1 BMGCs. While, mechanically driven tribolayer during sliding enables oxidative wear and improved tribological properties in the Ti45Zr25Nb6Cu5Be17Sn2 BMGC. Based on the synergistic mechanical and chemical effects, the underlying relationship between the intrinsic dendrite properties and the wear behaviors of BMGC was revealed.",0
"Energy levels, eigenfunctions and magnetic moments of rare earth ions in a crystal field of hexagonal symmetry have been obtained using a Hamiltonian of the form, H = Î¼ B gJ Â· H +B 4 0 O 4 0 + B 6 0(O 6 0 + 77 8 O 6 6). Results are presented for all J values appearing in the rare earth series and for values of the parameters covering the situations in which the crystal field interaction is dominant, in which the interaction with the magnetic field is dominant and in which the two interactions are comparable in magnitude.",0
In this study the influence of the interface of differently sized glass fibres on the mechanical properties of glass fibre/epoxy resin composites is investigated. It is of essential importance that all other parameters are kept constant so that the behaviour differences can only be attributed to interfacial phenomena. The results of micromechanical and macromechanical tests of unidirectional laminates characterize the fibre/matrix adhesion. In the second part of this study the tensile fatigue performance of cross ply laminates with two different sizings in the 0Â° and 90Â° layers is investigated. The best fatigue performance is determined for composites with a good fibre/matrix interaction in both layers.,0
"A new series of Dy3+ ions doped alkaline-earth chloro borate (AECB) glasses were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique and characterized with XRD, absorption, excitation, photoluminescence (PL), fluorescence decay spectral measurements and CIE coordinates. From the absorption spectra, Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters (Î©2, Î©4, Î©6) have been measured using the least square fit method. Under 385â¯nm excitation, intense blue, yellow emissions at 483 and 576â¯nm and weak red emission at 665â¯nm were observed, which are assigned to the 4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H15/2, 4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H13/2 and 4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H11/2 transitions of Dy3+ respectively. The yellow-to-blue emission intensity ratios and CIE chromaticity coordinates have been determined from emission spectra to evaluate the emitted light as a function of Dy3+ concentration. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of Dy3+ (1â¯mol%) doped AECB glasses are located in the white light region. The optimum doping concentration of Dy3+ ions is around 1â¯mol%, beyond which concentration quenching is observed. The decay spectral profiles of 4F9/2â¯ââ¯6H13/2 (577â¯nm) luminescence transition were used to measure experimental lifetimes (ÏR). The results indicate that Dy3+ doped AECB glasses may have great potential as a single-component white-light-emitting glass for UV-light-emitting diodes and for other visible photonic applications.",1
"Oxy-fluoride glass ceramics containing CaF2 crystals doped with YbF3âLnF3 (Ln=Er, Tm) were prepared by heat-treatment from SiO2âAl2O3âCaOâCaF2 glasses. The upconversion emission spectra of Er3+ and Tm3+ ions in the visible range were measured by 970nm pumping. In the spectrum of the Er doped sample, 540nm upconversion band due to the 4S3/2â4I15/2 and 660nm band due to the 4F9/2â4I15/2 were observed. In the Tm doped sample, a blue upconversion emission band due to the 1G4â3H6 was observed at 480nm as well as an 800nm band. The intensity of these upconversion emissions were very weak in the corresponding as-made glasses. These results indicate that rare-earth ions are incorporated in the CaF2 crystal phases after crystallization and the energy transfer efficiency from Yb3+ to Er3+ or Tm3+ are dramatically improved.",1
"The in situ methods have been developed in production of aluminum matrix composites. A commonly adopted in situ method involves reaction between a metal oxide and aluminum to produce alumina particles or whisker reinforcements. By completing the alumina formation reaction, the reduced metal usually further reacts with Al to form intermetallic phases, which also act as reinforcements in the matrix of the composite. In this work, CuO and amorphous SiO2 (glass powder) were introduced into pure Al melt to produce AlâAl2O3 in situ composites. Aluminum matrix composites were formed by dissolution of Cu and Si alloying elements and alumina particles. The size and shape of alumina particles were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mechanical properties of obtained composites were evaluated with tensile tests. The size of alumina obtained from mixture of SiO2 and CuO was bigger than the alumina particles obtained from CuO.",0
The infinite-ranged quantum XY spin glass in a transverse field with arbitrary spin is investigated via the replica approach using the Matsubara formalism. The equation for the phase diagram is calculated in the replica symmetric and static (with respect to the Matsubara time) approximations. The phase diagrams for a few spin values are obtained.,0
"A mathematical model was established to estimate the contributions of different mechanisms to the diffusion bonding of Zr-based bulk metallic glass to crystalline aluminum alloy. Additionally, the fraction of contact area with oxide film Ï was introduced into the model since oxide film is the main barrier to atomic bonding across interface at lower temperature. The model calculation displayed that the plastic deformation of Al alloy dominated the void formation stage, while the homogeneous plastic flow of BMG played a major role in the void shrinkage stage. The joints bonded by two different methods were used to verify the model. The experimental strength of joints achieved by pre-friction assisted diffusion bonding and Ar ion assisted diffusion bonding had a sound fit with the theoretical strength curves of Ï =28% and 22.5%, respectively.",0
"The structural transformations in silica glass that lead to changes in ion coordination under high pressure are examined with molecular simulations. These simulations determine the changes in the potential energy minima upon decreasing volume. The transformations are found to arise from discrete mechanical instabilities associated with disappearances of local minima on the potential energy surface. The ionic displacements arising from the mechanical instabilities are localized to a small number of ions, and involve primarily oxygen motion. The mechanical instabilities appear to be triggered in part by small SiâOâSi angles, which are highly strained. Compression of the glass also leads to a slight ordering of the oxygen ion packing.",1
"The experimental study of electrical transport in GeS x glasses (1.3 â©½ x â©½ 1.5) was performed by means of a thermo-stimulated depolarization technique (TSD), charging- and discharging-current and dc-conductivity measurements. It is shown that the results obtained point to non-electronic dielectric polarization phenomena. The nature of the mobile ions is briefly discussed.",1
"The 1 mol% of Eu3+-doped gadolinium calcium phosphate and fluorophosphates glasses were prepared by melt quenching technique and study on spectroscopic properties: absorption, emission spectra and decay time. The Judd-Ofelt parameters (Î©Î», Î» = 2, 4 and 6) were estimated by absorption results. All glasses show same trend of Î©2 > Î©4 > Î©6. The predicted radiative transition probabilities (AR), branching ratio (Î²R) and emission cross-section (Ïem(Î»)) for the 5D0 â 7F2 transition have been obtained which were used to estimate the red laser performance. The decay time of the 5D0 level of Eu3+-doped glasses promote single exponential. Besides, the radioluminescence spectrum was investigated on integral scintillation efficiency by comparing with Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO). It shows the integral scintillation efficiency is 62% of BGO and could be used as a good scintillator.",1
"A series of phosphor-in-glasses (PIGs) was prepared by one-step melt-quenching method sintering the mixture of tellurate raw material powder and YAG:Ce3+ phosphors at 450â700Â°C, of which some was annealed at 250Â°C for 3h under the hydrogen atmosphere. The test results show that the relative photoluminescence (PL) intensity of phosphor-in-glass sintered at 450â700Â°C was significantly strengthened from 42.29% to 174.72% after the hydrogen annealing, and the relative photoluminescence excitation (PLE) intensity from 21.00% to 207.90%. However, the relative photoluminescence intensity of the PIG sintered at 700Â°C before and after hydrogen annealing was nearly zero because of the destruction of crystal structural surrounding Ce3+ ion. The concentration of Ce3+ and Ce4+ measured by X-ray photoelectron spectrum analyser (XPS) in PIGs before and after hydrogen annealing obviously happened to change, which was associated with the variation of PL and PL excitation intensity. Besides, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of YAG:Ce3+ phosphor and PIGs sintered at different temperatures further presented the destruction of YAG:Ce3+ lattice as the sintering temperature increased. Therefore, the appropriate sintering temperature and hydrogen annealing can increase the PL and PLE intensity and the Ce3+ concentration.",1
"The shape memory effect and recovery ratio of dual-phase Ni58Mn25G16.9Gd0.1 alloy were investigated by bend test. The results show that this alloy exhibits good shape recovery capability. The recovery ratio of 86% is obtained with bend pre-strain of 4.6% after heating, which is larger than that of other reported dual-phase Ni-Mn-Ga alloys. This characteristic is attributed to the critical slip stress increasing of Î³ phase by small amount of Gd addition, improving the ability of Î³ phase to resist irreversible deformation.",0
"One of the distinguishing properties of spin glass (SG) systems is a long-time relaxation of magnetization below the SG transition temperature. Motivated by the interests on how the microscopic spin dynamics is related to the macroscopic behavior of spin system in the SG state, we have performed the Î¼SR measurement for a typical Ising SG system Fe0.50Mn0.50TiO3 under various experimental conditions. We also pay attention to how the spin dynamics responds to a sudden change of magnetic fields. Thus, we have discussed the spin dynamics of SG system which had not been detected before our Î¼SR measurement. For example, we have shown that the switching-off of a magnetic field at the field-cooled state makes the spin fluctuations faster. Moreover, such spin fluctuations have shown to remain faster at least up to the order of 2h, although the thermoremanent magnetization decays dramatically within 2h.",0
"The structural processes of transformation of the fragile glass former m-toluidine have been investigated by calorimetric (DSC) and X-ray experiments with some additional kinetic studies of the devitrification process. Recrystallisation is found to be controlled by the passage of the undercooled liquid at temperatures well below the glass transition. This atypic behaviour is basically due to the formation of cracks which cause heterogeneous nucleation. However, an additional non-classical decrease of the nucleation barrier is suspected. The investigation of the phase diagram of the crystalline state itself has revealed an interesting monotropic situation between two phases Î± and Î² with distinct X-ray diffraction patterns. This identification is useful in the investigation of the medium-range order which may develop in the liquid state.",0
"We construct a simple CPA for studying ferromagnets which simultaneously possess site and (isotropic) exchange bond disorders. We use the theory to study spin-wave stiffness in diluted ferromagnet with exchange amorphousness and analyze the structure of the interfaces between ferromagnetic, spin-glass and paramagnetic phases of such a system.",0
"A novel approach has been proposed to realize enhanced near-mid infrared emission in Ce3+ and Tm3+ co-doped oxyfluoride glasses excited at different wavelengths, whereby Ce3+ absorbs the photons in ultraviolet region and transfers the energy to Tm3+, while Tm3+ converts the energy in visible and near infrared region into near-mid infrared region. For the purpose to achieve efficient near-mid infrared emission, ligand field theory has been adopted to optimize the glass host composition. The excitation, emission, time-resolved emission spectra and fluorescence decay curves have been measured to investigate the energy transfer (ET) from Ce3+ to Tm3+ and the generation mechanism of near-mid infrared emission. This approach will be of reference value for designing the gain medium of the near-mid infrared laser excited directly by the sunlight.",1
"The volume-temperature curves of a number of poly(methyl methacrylate) fractions produced by various forms of catalysis have been investigated. It was confirmed that the isotactic samples have a much lower Tg than has conventional polymer. The highly syndiotactic polymer, however, was found to have a Tg not markedly different from that observed for conventional polymer in contrast with earlier published reports. The latter polymers show a more marked Î² transition.",0
"The formation of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) in ternary Cu-Zr-Ti system was investigated by a copper mold casting method. The nature of the amorphous phase was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was demonstrated that the BMGs could be formed in a broad composition range in this system. Cu50Zr42.5Ti7.5, Cu60Zr27.5Ti12.5, CU60Zr30Ti10, and Cu60Zr32.5Ti7.5 alloys exhibit strong glass-forming ability (GFA), and fully glassy rods of 5 mm in diameter can be obtained. In the center region of the ternary diagram, however, the GFA of the alloys was degraded due to the presence of Laves phase. The degradation of the GFA results from easy nucleation of the Laves phase in the undercooled liquid.",0
The paper presents adiabatic calorimetry investigations of slow relaxation processes (enthalpy relaxation) in isopentylcyanobiphenyl (right handed (s) 4â(2-methylbutyl) 4â²âcyanobiphenyl) in a vicinity of the glass transition. The preliminary neutron scattering results concerning the fast relaxation processes and low-energy excitation detected as âboson peakâ are also presented. The general behaviour observed in the experiments seems to correspond to the typical picture for the molecular glasses.,0
"Specimens of aluminium and aluminium alloys containing 0.1, 2, 6 and 12 wt.% Si were worn in single-pass sliding against glass countersurfaces. The wearing process was observed directly through the countersurface which, when combined with wear rate and coefficient of friction measurements, and with subsequent examination of specimens, gave a full appreciation of the origin and significance of features on the worn surfaces. Direct contact between the specimen and countersurface occurred only in the leading 1 Î¼m of specimens. Wear on the entire remainder of the surface was caused by interaction with debris from the pin and glass. A distinctive feature of much of this debris was that it was in the form of rolls. The wear rates and coefficient of friction were more affected by silicon in solution than silicon as particles.",0
"The Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped germanate-tellurite glasses with good thermal properties were prepared. A flat emission with full width at half maximum (FWHM)Â =Â 373Â nmÂ at â¼2Â Î¼m was observed in the prepared glass upon the 808Â nm excitation. Besides, the cross-sections of the prepared glass have been calculated, and the relative small peak absorption cross-sections (Ïabs) corresponding to the Ho3+: 5I7 â 5I8 is the factor to obtain the flat emission. Moreover, the energy transfer microscopic parameters (C DA ) between RE3+ ions have been investigated and quantitatively explained the observation of the flat and broadband emission. Furthermore, when PÂ =Â 0.2, the gain coefficient becomes positive which indicates the prepared glasses possess superior gain ability. The results indicate that the prepared glasses could be promising candidate for â¼2Â Î¼m tunable or ultrashort pulse laser materials.",1
"Transparent Er3+/Tm3+ co-doped tungsten-tellurite (TWL) glasses with variable Er3+ concentration were prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method. The samples prepared were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), absorption spectra, up-conversion, near and mid-infrared emission and lifetime decays. DSC analyses indicates a high transition temperature (Tg) and a large value of â³T. Enhanced 2.7â¯Î¼m emission in Er3+/Tm3+ co-doped TWL glasses presents its superiority in mid-infrared application. Based on above emission spectra and lifetime decays, the energy transfer mechanism between Er3+ and Tm3+ ions was discussed. Tm3+ ions are an effective sensitization for 2.7â¯Î¼m emission of Er3+ ions in this glass for its high energy transfer efficiency (83.6%). A comparative study on emission performance suggests that this Er3+/Tm3+ codoped TWL glass is a competent candidates for mid-infrared laser materials.",1
"Statement of problem Viscoelastic behavior can influence the fracture properties of glass ionomers, which is of clinical relevance. Glass-ionomer cements can display viscoelastic behavior, defined as having displacement rateâ or strain rateâdependent mechanical properties. Understanding and describing the viscoelastic behavior of glass ionomers is important to understanding their clinical behavior. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viscoelastic behavior of 6 glass-ionomer cements and determine whether there was a correlation to fracture toughness. Material and Methods Three conventional glass-ionomer cements (Î±-Silver, Î±-Fil, and Ketac-Molar) and 3 resin-modified glass-ionomer cements (Vitremer, Fuji II LC, and Photac-Fil Quick) were evaluated using measurements of compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS), and diametral tensile strength (DTS) at displacement rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm/min. The CS and DTS specimens were cured in glass tubes and cut to 4Â Ã 6-mm and 4 Ã 2-mm disk-shaped specimens, respectively. The FS specimens were cured in bar molds (2 Ã 2 Ã 15 mm). The fracture toughness (FT) specimens were cured in a minicompact mold to obtain precracked specimens. The mechanical testing results were compared statistically using generalized linear model/analysis of covariance and the Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch multiple range test at the Î±=.05 level. Results For all 3 mechanical properties, there was a displacement-rate dependence on the mechanical property. However, there were no differences in the displacement-rate dependence based on the type of materialâconventional glass ionomer or resin-modified glass ionomerâfor any of the mechanical properties. Only for FS test was there a significant difference based on the brand of material. There was no statistical difference in FT among the glass-ionomer cements tested, although the resin-modified glass ionomers tended to display higher FT. Conclusion A larger sample size and a much wider range of crosshead speeds are necessary to support a correlation between viscoelastic behavior and FT.",0
"In YbInCu4 a valence transition occurs from an almost stable trivalent phase for T>45K to an intermediate-valence state below 45K. We have investigated the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility Xâ³ of YbInCu4 above and below the transition and compared it with spectra of the stable valent compound YbInNi4. YbInNi4 and YbInCu4 in the trivalent phase exhibit crystal-field (CF) excitations, centered at about 4meV. Below the valence transition in YbInCu4 the CF excitations disappear and instead we observe a broad magnetic signal centered at about 40meV, i.e., energy transfers ten times larger than the position of the CF lines of the stable valent phase.",0
"The tensile strength of glass fiber bundles is highly dependent on flaw nucleation and growth from contact abrasion and hydrolytic degradation. The effect of fiber surface treatment on the hydrolytic stability of tensile strength is investigated for E-glass fiber bundles with four commercial sizings. Acoustic emission (AE) generated by individual fiber fracture events provides a means to determine a Weibull distribution of fiber strengths. Fiber bundles with starch, starch and silane, starch and wax, and epoxy surface treatments are tested following exposure to 10%, 40%, 80% relative humidity and immersion in water. The tensile break strength, number of breaks at peak load, and Weibull moduli of the glass fiber bundles are strongly dependent on the humidity level. The different surface treatments considered in this investigation strongly alter the absolute mechanical properties and the effect of exposure to humidity.",0
"Perovskite glasses with the compositions of La0.85-x Er x Bi0.15Al0.5Ga0.5O3 (xâ¯=â¯0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15) and remarkable electrical insulation performance were synthesized by containerless solidification. The xâ¯=â¯0.15 amorphous material had the highest Vicker's hardness (7.34â¯GPa). The transmittance reached as high as 86% in the infrared (IR) region. The absorption peaks in the UVâvisâNIR region of transmittance spectra could be attributed to the transitions of Er3+ ions from the ground state 4I15/2 to excited states. All transparent samples emitted intense green emissions when excited at 379â¯nm, corresponding to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 to 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions. The average decay life-time decreased from 25.3 Î¼s to 6.1â¯Î¼s with increasing Er3+ ion content, revealing the interaction within ErâEr clusters.",1
"It is an obstacle issue for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) particularly for single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with nano-level dispersion in fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites. In this paper, the dispersing agents such as Volan and BYK-9076 were employed to treat SWCNTs to improve their dispersion in the glass fiber/epoxy (GF/EP) composites. The dispersing results of SWCNTs in composites were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then the glass transition temperature (T g) of these kinds of composites with treated and untreated SWCNTs were obtained by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Moreover, the flexural tests were performed on these composites. Based on the experiment results, the dispersion of SWCNTs was improved and the flexural property of SWCNTs/GF/EP composite was enhanced too.",0
"The crystal growth kinetics of antimony trisulfide in (GeS2)0.1(Sb2S3)0.9 glass has been studied by microscopy and DSC. The linear crystal growth kinetics has been confirmed in the temperature range 492â©½ T â©½515K (E G =405Â±7kJmolâ1). The applicability of standard growth models has been assessed. From the crystal growth rate corrected for viscosity plotted as a function of undercooling it has been found that the most probable mechanism is interface controlled 2D nucleated growth. The non-isothermal DSC data, corresponding to the bulk sample, can be described by the JohnsonâMehlâAvrami equation.",1
"A protective double layered glassâceramic coating was produced by slurry technique in order to improve the oxidation resistance of Ti-5.8Al-4Sn-3.5Zr-0.7Nb-0.5Mo-0.35Si-0.06C-0.09O, wt.%, at temperatures above 600Â°C. A SiO2âP2O5âB2O3âCaOâK2OâNa2O layer was produced as the outer layer, with self-healing properties. Analytical scanning- and transmission electron microscopy were used for detailed analyses of the microstructure and phase composition of the coating. It was found that both layers contain several crystalline and amorphous phases. It was established that the double layered glassâceramic coating formed on TIMETAL 834 shows higher hardness than the substrate alloy and better oxidation resistance at elevated temperature, since no weight change of the coated alloy was observed after oxidation for 300h at 800Â°C. The self-healing behaviour of the outer layer was also demonstrated.",0
"Photoluminescence (PL) characterization of Lithium Lead Alumino Borate (LiPbAlB) glasses doped with Sm3+ ions at varying concentrations have been studied by using absorption, excitation, emission, time resolved and confocal image measurements. From the absorption spectra, Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters were evaluated and in turn used to estimate various radiative parameters for the fluorescent levels of Sm3+ ion doped LiPbAlB glasses. The PL spectra of Sm3+ ions exhibit three emission bands corresponding to the transitions 4G5/2Â âÂ 6H5/2, 6H7/2 and 6H9/2, for which the emission cross-sections and branching ratios were evaluated to know the potentialities of these materials as visible luminescent devices. The decay spectral profiles measured for 4G5/2Â âÂ 6H7/2 transition level were used to estimate quantum efficiency of the as-prepared glasses. The non-exponential decay curves observed for higher Sm3+ ion concentrations were well fitted to Inokuti-Hirayama model to understand the predominant energy transfer mechanism involved in the as-prepared glasses. CIE chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperatures (CCT) were evaluated to understand the utility of the titled glasses in cool white light generation. The confocal images captured under 405Â nm CW laser excitation show intense reddish-orange color. From the evaluated radiative parameters, emission cross-sections, quantum efficiency, CIE co-ordinates, CCT temperatures and confocal images, it was observed that LiPbAlB glass with 0.5Â mol% Sm3+ ions are more suitable for w-LEDs and reddish-orange luminescent device applications.",1

"This experimental research aims to determine the influence of reinforcement hybridisation onto basic mechanical properties of misaligned short-fibre composites. For this purpose different short-fibre hybrid polypropylene composites with E-glass and cellulose reinforcements, which are characterised by different stress-strain characteristics were compounded and injection moulded. The volumetric fractions of reinforcement and compatibiliser contents were maintained at the proportional volumetric levels to enable correlation of filling ratios and reinforcement geometry with mechanical performance of the manufactured hybrids. This research helps to foresee mechanical performance of the newly developed hybrids and gives clues to effective hybridisation by showing the basic dependencies. It was found that especially flexural strength can be boosted by the addition of a second filler to short-fibres owing to its better response to compressive stresses during 3-point bending of the bar, as long as its Young's modulus is in the range or higher than that of fibres, has similar stress-strain characteristics and its good bonding with matrix is provided. The hybridisation of short-fibres with microfillers also reduces void content and fibre damage upon processing.",0
"(Ti40Zr10Cu36Pd14)100âx Nb x (x =1, 3, 5at.%) bulk metallic glasses containing nano-particles exhibited ultrahigh strength and distinct plastic strain. The yield strength exceeding 2050MPa, Young's modulus of about 80GPa and the plastic strain of over 6.5% were obtained for 1% and 3% Nb-added alloys due to the suppression of the propagation of shear bands by nano-particles in situ formed in the glassy matrix. The developed Ni-free Ti-based bulk metallic glasses with low Young's modulus and good mechanical properties are promising candidates for application as artificial dental root materials and other biomaterials.",0
"Thirty years ago Fukuyama [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 45 (1978) 1474] predicted a transition from charge density wave (CDW) state to the charge density glass (CDG) at a finite temperature as the consequence of the competition between the uniform commensurability pinning and the random impurity pinning. We present strong evidence that the CDG phase indeed exists as a generic feature of density wave systems. However, it arises from the competition of the random impurity pinning and the electrostatic intra-CDW interaction which tends to establish a uniform phase at low temperature. The glass transition occurs at the temperature at which the free carriers cannot efficiently screen the phase distortions. The characteristic length scale of the disorder, i.e. the size of the phase coherent domains, governs the glass properties.",0
"The tensile and flexural properties, together with the unnotched and notched impact strengths of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), glass bead (GB) and glass fiber (GF) ternary composites have been studied. The tensile strengths of the hybrid composites were predicted, from a theory formulated in this study, by using the strengths of the ABS/GB and ABS/GF composites alone. The addition of even a small quantity of glass fiber to ABS or ABS/GB composites changes the mode of deformation from one which shows vacuole growth and crazing to brittle failure. Thus, the elongation at break, the area under the stress/strain curve and the impact energy decrease sharply with the introduction of glass fiber to ABS or ABS/GB composites.",0
"Susceptibility and hysteresis measurements indicate that the system Fe3âxTixO4 forms only monodomains for 1.0 â©¾ x â©¾ 0.3 irrespective of the physical grain size. Sharp susceptibility maxima, resembling those of spin glasses, are obtained for 1.0 â©¾ x â©¾ 0.8, which could be attributed to the combined effect of decreasing anisotropy and the monodomains becoming superparamagnetic with increasing temperature.",0
"The paper reports the results of an experimental programme aimed at examining the performance of Portland-cement concrete produced with washed glass sand (WGS), as natural sand substitute- by mass. The effects of up to 50% WGS on fresh, engineering and durability related properties have been established and its suitability for use in a range of normal-grade concrete production assessed. WGS characteristics results showed that the post-container glass waste can be crushed to provide WGS of physical properties that satisfy the current requirements set in appropriate standards for natural sand for concrete. The density and water absorption of WGS was found to be lower than natural sand. The results for fresh concrete showed a reduction in workability of concrete with increase WGS proportion beyond 20% in the mix, although slump measurements remained within the allowable margin of Â±25mm. The mixes with high proportions of WGS were found to be less cohesive. Studies of hardened concrete properties, comprising bulk engineering properties (compressive cube and cylinder strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, drying shrinkage) and durability (near surface absorption, alkali silica reaction) showed similar performance for concrete produced with natural aggregates and up to 15% WGS.",0

"A semi-batch pyrolysis process was used to recover samples carbon fibre and glass fibre from their respective wastes. The mechanical properties of the recovered fibres were tested and compared to those of virgin fibres, showing good retention of the fibre properties. The recovered fibres were then used to prepare new LDPE composite materials with commercial and laboratory-synthesized compatibilizers. Mild oxidation of the post-pyrolysis recovered fibres and the use of different compatibilizers gave significant improvements in the mechanical properties of the LDPE composites; however some of the manufactured composites made from recovered fibres had properties similar to those made from virgin fibres.",0
"(Ba, La)-tellurite glasses doped respectively with only Yb3+, only Ho3+ and co-doped with (Yb3+ +Ho3+) have been prepared and their optical properties are studied. The experimental absorption and the emission spectra of the Ho3+ doped glass and calculations of its various JuddâOfelt parameters, show that the Ho3+ ion in the glass has superior absorption and emission transition probabilities and higher emission rates and emission cross-sections. Similar spectroscopic studies on the Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped â glass; on the other hand, demonstrate that the â¼2.0Î¼m emission of Ho3+ of the glass can further be enhanced by phonon assisted non-resonance energy transfer from Yb3+. The derived emission cross-section spectrum of the 5I7 â 5I8 transition of Ho3+ of the glass and its related gain spectrum, indicate that the glass is prospective for use as a tunable solid state laser medium in this spectral region 1.972â2.053Î¼m. Yb3+ âHo3+ energy transfer phenomenon also helps the Ho3+ ions of the co-doped glass to exhibit strong green (545nm) and red (600nm) upconversion emission upon excitation of its Yb3+ ions by 980nm laser. All the observed superior optical properties of Ho3+ ion in the glass have been explained in the light of crystal field effect of the host.",1
"We report temperature dependence of FMR linewidths (Î) for a set of amorphous FeyNi80âyP14B6 alloys. The linewidths show maxima as a function of T. However, the temperatures (Tm) corresponding to the maxima not only differ from the low field freezing temperatures reported earlier but also depend on microwave frequency. We contend that the Tm â²s should not be used to identify the zero-field ferromagnetic-spin glass transition line.",0
"Bi2O3 doped 65SiO2â20Al2O3â15La2O3 (in mole%) glasses were prepared by the traditional meltingâquenching method. The spectroscopic properties and mechanism of NIR broadband emission in these glasses were investigated in this work. Three excitation wavelengths of 500, 700 and 800nm were used to test emission spectra. The emission band under 500nm excitation can be regarded as combination of emission bands under 700 and 800nm excitation. 2.0mole% is found to be the optimal Bi2O3 doping level in this glass. Under 500nm excitation its emission peak, FWHM and lifetime of emission band are 1160nm, 300nm and 569Î¼s, respectively. The longest fluorescent lifetime reaches 620Î¼s under 700nm excitation. The valence state of Bi in these glasses is suggested to be lower than +3 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. With the help of energy matching, we infer that both Bi0 and Bi+ centers are responsible for the NIR fluorescence of Bi2O3 doped 65SiO2â20Al2O3â15La2O3 glass.",1
"The effects of matrices from co-cured blends of an unsaturated polyester (UP) with inherently fire-retardant and char-forming phenolic resoles (PH) on the mechanical and fire performances of resultant glass fibre-reinforced composites have been investigated. Three different phenolic resoles with increasing order of compatibility with UP have been used. These are: (i) an ethanol soluble resin, (PHâS), (ii) an epoxy-functionalised resin (PH-Ep), and (iii) an allyl-functionalised resin (PHâAl). The mechanical properties of the composites increased with increasing compatibility with two resin types as might be expected, but not previously demonstrated. However, even with the least compatible resin (PHâS), the impact properties were unaffected and the flexural/tensile properties while reduced, were still acceptable for certain applications. Fire properties were however, in reverse order as previously observed in cast resin samples from these composites. Moreover, the reduction in flammability was less compared to those of the cast resin samples, reported previously, explained here based on the insulating effect of glass fibre reinforcement.",0
"An overview is given of recent studies of crystal nucleation and growth in silicate and phosphate based glasses, emphasising microstructural characterisation. The following topics are discussed: nucleation kinetics in silicate systems, comparisons with classical theory, and new evidence in the early stages of crystallisation of Li2O Â· 2SiO2 glass for the appearance of previously unreported metastable precursor phases, probably crystalline polymorphs of lithium disilicate; the role of P2O5 as a nucleating agent in lithiaâsilica glasses; volume nucleation and glass ceramic formation in CaOî¸P2O5 based glasses, particularly the roles of additions of Al2O3. TiO2, SiO2 and B2O3; crystallisation of aluminosilicate glasses including celsian and barium osumilite compositions, and marked differences in crystallisation between melt-derived and solâgel derived compositions.",1
"In the present study, the self-ability based on the microcapsule healing system on the glass fibers-epoxy smart composites was investigated. The microcapsulesâ shell and healing agent comprised urea-formaldehyde and diluted epoxy, respectively. The synthesized microcapsules by one-stage in-situ polymerization method were dispersed with the different percentage of 7, 14 and 21â¯wt% into the epoxy resin. Then, the epoxy-glass fibers composites with the self-healing ability were fabricated by hand lay-up method. The self-healing composites damaged by various damage forces through a quasi-static penetration method. Therefore, the damage forces of 800, 1050 and 1300â¯N for tensile samples and 2500, 2900 and 3300â¯N for interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) samples were selected. The obtained results showed that adding 14â¯wt% microcapsules into the composite increased the tensile strength, due to the crack pining and deflection mechanisms. Whereas, by increasing the percentage of microcapsules up to 21â¯wt%, the shear strength of composite was reduced, compared with the pristine composite. The maximum obtained healing efficiency for both tensile and ILSS tests were 97.5 and 144.5%, respectively, which belonged to 21â¯wt% microcapsules-loaded composite. The microscopically investigations of interactions between microcapsules and micro-cracks at the fracture surface illustrated the crack pinning, deflecting, and bowing mechanisms. Also, rupturing the microcapsules, wetting the damaged area by healing agent and forming the polymeric shell in the damaged area were seen.",0
"In this paper the effect of voids formed in both the glass/epoxy and GLARE laminates on their long-term hygrothermal behaviors are evaluated. By adopting different autoclave pressures during a cure cycle, the specimens with different void contents ranging from 0.5% to 2.0% were obtained for both materials. Two types of hygro and thermal aging tests were then carried out according to water absorption in distilled water and thermal cyclic fatigue up to 1500 cycles, respectively. The resulting behaviors of degradation for both materials due to two types of aging tests were evaluated by the test for interlaminar shear strength which is highly affected by those types of aging. Experimental results indicate that the autoclave pressure enhances a certain extent of the GLAREâs interfacial bonding with the low void contents. It therefore leads to an increase in the resistance to the hygro and thermal agings.",0
"According to a recent study, Fe-based glassy alloys are expected good soft-magnetic properties such as high saturation magnetization and lower coercive force. We focused on Fe-based glassy alloys and have succeeded in developing novel glassy Fe97âxây P x B y Nb2Cr1 (x =5â13, y =7â15) alloys for an inductor material. The glassy alloy series of Fe97âxây P x B y Nb2Cr1 (x =5â13, y =7â15) have high glass-forming ability with the large critical thickness of 110â150Î¼m and high B s of 1.25â1.35T. The glassy alloy powder with chemical composition Fe77P10.5B9.5Nb2Cr1 exhibits an excellent spherical particle shape related to the lower melting point and liquid phase point. In addition, FeâPâBâNbâCr powder/resin composite core has much lower core loss of 653â881kW/m3, which is approximately 1/3 lower than the conventional amorphous FeâSiâBâCr powder/resin composite core and 1/4 lower than the conventional crystalline FeâSiâCr powder/resin composite core due to the lower coercive force of 2.5â3.1A/m. Based on above results, the glassy Fe77P10.5B9.5Nb2Cr1 alloy powder enable to achieve ultra-high efficient and high quality products in a commercial inductor. In fact, the surface mounted inductor using FeâPâBâNbâCr powder/resin exhibits the high efficiency of approximately 2.0% compared with the conventional inductors made of the crystalline FeâSiâCr powder/resin composite core.",0
"Statement of problem Fiber-reinforcement has been used to overcome the mechanical limitations of denture base polymers. One major difficulty in the use of fiber reinforcement has been the addition of fibers during conventional processing methods. Purpose This study evaluated the effect of various lengths and concentrations of chopped E-glass fiber-reinforcement on the transverse strength, modulus of elasticity, and impact strength of injection and compression-molded polymethyl methacrylate based denture base polymer. Material and methods Test specimens (n=10) of 4-, 6-, and 8-mm fiber length and 1%, 3%, and 5% weight fiber concentrations were prepared with either an injection or a compression-molded processing method. Denture base polymer specimens without any fiber reinforcement were used as control for both processing methods. Transverse strength test specimens (65 Ã 10 Ã 2.5 mm) were stored in water bath at 37Â°C for 2 weeks. The transverse strength (MPa) and modulus of elasticity (GPa) was measured with the 3-point bending test. Impact strength (kJ/m2) test specimens (60 Ã 7.5 Ã 4 mm) were tested with the Charpy-type pendulum impact test setup. The data were analyzed with multifactorial analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc tests (Î±=.05). Results Injection-molded fiber-reinforced groups showed significantly higher transversal strength, elastic modulus, and impact strength compared with compression-molded groups (P < .001). In the injection-molded groups, fiber concentration increased all mechanical properties tested (P < .05), but fiber length only increased transverse strength and modulus of elasticity (P < .05). In the compression molded groups, fiber concentration affected modulus of elasticity and impact strength significantly (P < .05), but fiber length did not show any significant effect on the mechanical properties tested (P > .05). Conclusion The transverse strength, elastic modulus and impact strength of injection-molded denture base polymer increased significantly with the use of chopped E-glass fibers, whereas the effect was not significant with the compression-molded polymer.",0

"Binary alloys of In x Se100âx (with x=7,12,17 and 22) were synthesized by mechanical alloying technique (MA). Then thin films of 200 nm in thickness were prepared by thermal evaporation technique under vacuum of 2Ã10â5 Torr . X-ray diffraction patterns were investigated indicating that the films are amorphous in nature. Optical properties were investigated for the binary system by using spectrophotometer transmittance spectra in the wavelength (200â1100 nm ). Optical constants, absorbance X(Î») and complex dielectric constant have been determined using Swanepole method. Optical dispersion parameters E o and E d that were developed by WempleâDiDmenico and the high frequency dielectric constant (Îµ â) have been also, analyzed. The variations of the optical energy gap E g for all the films composition were discussed.",1
An irreversible pressure induced semiconductor-to-metal transition in bulk Ge20Te80 glass is observed at about 5 GPa pressure. The high pressure phase has a face centered cubic structure with a lattice constant 6.42 AÂ° as deduced by X-ray diffraction studies on the pressure quenched samples. The temperature and pressure dependence of the electrical resistivity confirms the observed transition to be a semiconductor-to-metal transition. The temperature dependence of thermo electric power is also reported.,1

"Glasses exhibit intriguing physical and mechanical properties resulting from their structure. We have investigated metalâglass dynamics using inelastic X-ray scattering and ultrasonic techniques for several Pd-, Pt-, and Zr-based glasses with varying fragility. In some cases we have observed a faster phase velocity at short wavelengths than long wavelengths, or positive dispersion. Here we apply elastic wave scattering theory to suggest that the behavior of acoustic phonons can be understood by considering the presence of intrinsic nanoscale elastic inhomogeneity with a certain correlation length, i.e., âstatic heterogeneityâ. Furthermore, we suggest that such an elastic inhomogeneity could be the origin of many of the interesting physical and mechanical properties of metallic glasses.",0
"In complex systems like polymer glass-forming materials the relaxation is well described by the Kohlrausch equation Ï(t)â¼ exp â(t/Ï)n . The exponent n is interpreted as the inverse of the number of simple motions (of Î² type) which must occur simultaneously to give a cooperative motion (of Î± type), then a coupling relation between the relaxation time Ï and the Kauhlrausch exponent n is similar to the Ngai relation. It is shown that the scaling law n=T and nâ¼â1/T leads to the VFT law and to a modified VFT law without adjustable parameter, valid between the Kauzmann temperature and the bifurcation temperature Tâ where the Î± and Î² relaxations merge together.",0
"The electrical properties of glasses have been of interest in science and industry for many years. Semiconducting and ionic conduction properties of such systems can be explained using different theoretical models.

"This study presents the luminescent properties of Yb3+/Tm3+ co-dopant ions inside a new host glass based on bismuth germanates. JuddâOfelt intense parameters, radiative transition rate, radiative lifetime, and branching ratios of Tm3+ in the present glass are calculated based on the absorption spectrum. A strong 1.8Î¼m emission was observed in the Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped bismuth germanate glass upon the excitation of a conventional 980nm laser diode. Using a spectral overlap model, the micro parameter for direct energy transfer from Yb3+ ions to Tm3+ ions (C DA ) was found to be almost 30 times larger than the back energy transfer from Tm3+ ions to Yb3+ ions (C AD ). The linear dependence of energy transfer probability on the co-dopant concentration exhibits that the energy transfer is assisted by energy migration among donor ions. The large energy transfer efficiency (89%) indicates that the Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped bismuth germanate glass is a good candidate for the 1.8Î¼m laser.",1
"One-dimensional titanium dioxide nanostructures have been studied intensively and extensively due to their outstanding properties and their diverse technological applications in photovoltaic cells. Interestingly, single crystalline TiO2 nanorods (TiO2 NRs) offer more advantageous compared with TiO2 particles and polycrystalline. TiO2 NRs produce direct electrical pathways of photogenerated carriers as well as large surface areas between NRs. This work presents a synthesis of vertically-aligned and uniform TiO2 NRs that were hydrothermally grown on a transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. The substrates were seeded with TiO2 compact layer (CL) using titanium (IV) butoxide as a precursor in HCl solution. Various techniques, including field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to investigate the morphology and crystalline structure of the prepared TiO2 NRs. FE-SEM results revealed that the TiO2 NRs showed a rod-like nanostructure which could increase the accessible surface area.In addition, the effect on Ti initial reactant concentration was optimized to have desirable properties on the TiO2 NRsâ density, diameter and length. As a result, the as-prepared TiO2 NRs could have very good prospects in high-performance perovskite solar cell as electron transporting layers.",0
The fabrication of Dy:PbI2/glass (DyÂ =Â 0.0 to 0.8Â wt%) films were performed using a spin coating process. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of monophasic hexagonal films growth along (001) planes. The estimated size of crystallites was noticed to be in the range of 16â22Â nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study indicates the strong effect of Dy content on the morphology of film surface and the grown grain sizes were in 13â70Â nm range. EDX/SEM e-mapping approves the existence of Dy in PbI2 films. The transparency of grown films was found to be in the range of 60 to 87%. Optical bandgap was estimated to be 2.21Â eVâ2.35Â eV range. The values of index of refraction was found in 2â8 range. The constant of dielectric values was noted in the range of 5â50 and showed an enhancement by Dy doping. The value of Ï(1) was noticed to be increased by Dy content doping and found in the range of 0.2â7. The Ï(3) values were calculated in the range of 3.4Â ÃÂ 10â1 3 to 3800Â ÃÂ 10â10Â esu. The n2 values were noted to be in the range of 6Â ÃÂ 10â12 to 1.5Â ÃÂ 10â6Â esu.

"The effect of Al content on the glass formation and mechanical properties was studied for (Cu50Zr50)100âx Al x (x =0, 4, 5, 7) bulk metallic glasses. The crystallization temperatures of fully amorphous Cu50Zr50, Cu48Zr48Al4, Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 and Cu46.5Zr46.5Al7 as-cast rods are 724K, 753K, 758K and 782K, respectively. The mechanical properties were investigated under compression at room temperature. As-cast Cu46.5Zr46.5Al7 shows the highest yield strength (1867MPa), whereas Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 shows the largest fracture strain of 11.2%. The fracture surfaces of the compressed samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and their morphology has been correlated with the compressive plasticity.",0
"This paper investigates the through-thickness tensile behavior of woven glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite laminates at cryogenic temperatures. Tensile tests were carried out with cross specimens at room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature (77Â K), and the through-thickness elastic and strength properties of the woven GFRP laminates were evaluated. The failure characteristics of the woven GFRP laminates were also studied by optical and laser scanning microscopy observations. A three-dimensional finite element analysis was performed to calculate the stress distributions in the cross specimens, and the failure conditions of the specimens were examined. It is found that the cross specimen is suitable for the cryogenic through-thickness tensile characterization of laminated composite materials. In addition, the through-thickness Young's modulus of the woven GFRP composite laminates is dominated by the properties of the matrix polymer in the given temperature, while the tensile strength is characterized by both, the fiber to matrix interface energy and the cohesion energy of the matrix polymer.",0
"0.5â¯mol% of europium (Eu3+) doped bismuth phosphate glasses (BiP) with different contents (0, 5, 10 and 15â¯mol%) of bismuth and different (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) mol% of Eu3+ doped 5â¯mol% bismuth contained BiP glasses were made by melt-quenching technique. The structural and photoluminescence properties were analysed via FT-Raman, excitation, luminescence and decay time computations. Judd-Ofelt (J-O) parameters were evaluated from the emission spectra and also various radiative properties such as radiative transition probabilities (AR), radiative lifetimes (Ïrad), stimulated emission cross-sections (Ïe), branching ratios (Î²), optical gain bandwidths (ÏexÎÎ»eff) and optical gain (ÏexÏrad) values for the observed emission transitions are studied. The electron-phonon coupling constants (g), phonon energies (hÏ) and the multiphonon relaxation rates (WMPR) were determined. The decay curves of 5D0 level of Eu3+ in all the studied glasses exhibit single exponential nature. The lifetimes are obtained from the decay curves and reported. The CIE chromaticity co-ordinates were computed and they have fallen in red region. The characteristic red luminescence emission around 612â¯nm for 5D0â7F2 transition confirmed that the Eu3+ doped BiP glasses might be useful to fabricate red lasers and display devices.",1
"It is shown that in perfect covalent glasses (and some local structures) the self-trapping of negative-U electron (on hole) pairs is realized on selected âflexibleâ atomic configurations. The basic concepts of the theory of the phenomenon are presented; the criteria and some associated effects are analyzed. The selected configuration contains an appropriate atom (atomic group) in âcritical local potentialâ with unusually small spring constant in respective well. The phenomenon (self-trapping of electron or hole pair) can generate both Anderson negative-U centres in âperfectâ glass (i.e. not associated with defects in glasses) and, possibly, a class of deep-level impurity centres in some crystals.",0
JuddâOfelt analysis of Sm3+ ions doped in a tellurite glass has been accomplished. Fluorescence and life-time measurements have been carried out using Ar+ laser and excimer laser. Stark splitting has been observed in the upper and lower levels in fluorescence. The life-time of 4G5/2 level as a function of Sm3+ concentration has been measured. Concentration quenching and the mechanism responsible for the same have been found.,1
"A new strategy for simultaneously increasing strength and ductility of the AlâCu alloys was reported here, that is: the inoculated AlâCu alloys by Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 metallic glass showed the superior strength and ductility than the uninoculated alloy. The highest tensile strength and ductility of the inoculated alloy by Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 metallic glass were 569MPa and 11.1%, improved by 15.3% and 58.5%, respectively, than those of the uninoculated alloys. These enhanced properties are suggested to be induced by the refined Î±-Al grains and the smaller nano-sized Î¸â² precipitates.",0
"The aim of this work is to study the mechanical behavior of a hybrid composite based on polyester thermoset matrix reinforced by a mixture of Luffa (LF) and Glass (GF) fibers. The whole volume fraction of the fibers was limited to 20â¯vol% in which the LF fraction was varied from 5â¯vol% to 20â¯vol%. Composites plates were prepared using the resin transfer molding (RTM) method. The morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the mechanical properties of the composites were characterized using tensile, three pointsâ flexural tests and hardness. Obtained results have shown that the mechanical properties of the hybrid composites were superior to those of polyester/LF composite. The mechanical properties depend on the GF fraction and on the organization of GF and LF sheets in the composite. The analytical modeling of tensile properties showed that the mechanical behavior of these hybrid composites is better described by the model of Hirsch with an adjustable value between 0.37 and 0.55. In addition, the water absorption behavior of these hybrid composites was also investigated during 200â¯h.",0
"This study investigates the tension-tension fatigue behaviour of glass/epoxy quasi-isotropic laminates. Constant amplitude tension-tension fatigue tests were performed at different stress level at a stress ratio, Râ¯=â¯0.1 and at a frequency of 3â¯Hz. The damage growth in the material was characterized by evaluating the degradation in stiffness. A phenomenological cumulative stiffness degradation based damage model was used to predict the damage development in the material. It was observed that, in the initial fatigue loading cycle, the material exhibited rapid reduction in stiffness and maintained a constant rate of degradation until failure.",0
Graphene oxide (GO) sheets were covalently grafted onto glass fibers (GFs) to improve the interfacial properties of GFs/polymer composites. It was confirmed that GO sheets were chemically grafted onto GFs via amido bond. The surface configuration of GFs changed by GO sheets could enhance strength and toughness of the interfacial region between GFs and polymer matrix. This strategy has the potential to be applied in high performance polymer matrix composites.,0
"The aim of this study was to synthesize a new tooth-filling material and to evaluate the in vitro behavior and mechanical properties. New composite cement was prepared and optimized by mixing hydroxyapatite (HAp), alumina/zirconia nanocomposite (HANBG), and nanobioactive glass (NBG). Then, the prepared composite cement was compared with the conventional glass ionomer cement for different parameters such as initial setting time and mechanical properties. The composition of composite cement was determined by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope studies. The prepared HANBG composite showed an increase in hardness (1.13GPa) and Young×³s modulus (22.89GPa). In vitro bioactivity of the nanocomposite cements was studied using simulated body fluid and better biocompatibility was confirmed with an increase in HAp layer formation. Similarly, the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Bacillus spp. was also studied. From the observed results, it was concluded that HANBG (a new dental nanocomposite prepared by mixing HAp with NBG and alumina/zirconia nanocomposite) samples show improved setting time, bioactivity, and antimicrobial activity. Therefore, HANBG cement can act as a potential candidate for tooth restoration applications.",0
Fluorescent quantum efficiencies of green luminescence of the 4 S 3 2 level of Er3+ in tellurite glasses was obtained from the fluorescence and absorption spectra of erbium. The quantum efficiency was determined by the comparative method. The influence of the glass phonons on the fluorescent efficiencies is derived from the comparison of erbium fluorescence in tellurite and germanate glasses.,1
"Strong inelastic scattering of neutrons extends along the first Brillouin zone boundary of FCC structure on Mn 73 Cu 27 alloy at room temperature, indicating that Mn spins fluctuate dynamically with strong spin correlations. The fluctuation is considered to be caused by geometrical spin frustration of the octahedral antiferromagnet and suppresses the magnetic LRO. At low temperature, part of spins freezes due to the randomness of atomic arrangements, resulting in spin-glass-like behavior.",0
"The superplastic deformation behavior and superplastic forming ability of the Zr41.25Ti13.75Ni10Cu12.5Be22.5 (at.%) bulk metallic glass (BMG) in the supercooled liquid region were investigated. The isothermal tensile results indicate that the BMG exhibits a Newtonian behavior at low strain rates but a non-Newtonian behavior at high-strain rates in the initial deformation stage. The maximum elongation reaches as high as 1624% at 656K, and nanocrystallization was found to occur during the deformation process. Based on the analysis on tensile deformation, a gear-like micropart is successfully die-forged via a superplastic forging process, demonstrating that the BMG has excellent workability in the supercooled liquid region.",0
"Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) Fe61Co6Zr8âx Hf x Mo7B15Al1Y2 (x =0â8) have been produced by copper mold casting technique using industrial raw materials. The effect of substitution of Hf for Zr on the glass forming ability (GFA) and the magnetic property has been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). It was found that the substitution of an appropriate amount of Hf for Zr can improve the GFA of the base alloy Fe61Co6Zr8Mo7B15Al1Y2, as demonstrated by the increase in reduced glass transition temperature T rg (=T g/T l) and GFA parameters of Î³ (=T x/T g + T l) and Î´ (=T x/T l â T g). The Fe61Co6Zr5Hf3Mo7B15Al1Y2 alloy exhibits the highest GFA with the largest T rg (0.612) and Î´ (1.633), and can cast a fully amorphous rod in 3mm diameter. The substitution of Hf for Zr also enhances the magnetic properties, as verified by the increase in saturation magnetization (M s) in the alloy of Fe61Co6Zr3Hf5Mo7B15Al1Y2, whose M s is approximately 1.5 times higher than that of the base alloy (x =0) at room temperature. Finally, the effect of the substitution of Hf for Zr on glass forming ability and magnetic properties is discussed.",0
"Monolithic Î±-SiC particles and in situ Î²-Si3N4-reinforced barium aluminosilicate (BAS) glass ceramic matrix composites with good mechanical properties were obtained by spark plasma sintering. However, attempts at the synthesis of ternary phase composites in order to maximize the reinforcing effects by co-adding Î±-SiC and Î²-Si3N4 were only partly successful. Î²-Si3N4 grain growth was remarkably hindered by the coexistent Î±-SiC, thus the resultant composite suffered a loss of reinforcement efficiency.",0
"The design and synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER are important for energy storing applications. In this communication, Cu(TCNQ)2 nanorod arrays have been designed and synthesized successfully with a Cu(Fe)OOH nanosheet shell by using a short oxidation process of Cu(TCNQ)2 and subsequently an ultrafast ion exchange reaction. They are expected to combine a variety of desired merits including a simple and rapid preparation process, a large specific surface area, high conductivity and multiple electrocatalytic active sites. All the worthy characteristics which make Cu(TCNQ)2@Cu(Fe)OOH are endowed with an excellent OER catalytic performances with the required overpotential of 261â¯mV at 25â¯mAâ¯cmâ2 only. The present work not only produces a good OER catalyst but also provides us a new idea to design efficient OER electrocatalysts.",0
"Praseodymium doped TeO2âBaF2âNaF glasses were prepared by conventional quenching melt technique. Optical absorption spectra have been investigated using JuddâOfelt (JO) theory. Radiative transition probabilities and branching ratios were calculated. The branching ratios for the 1D2â3F4 and 3P0â3F2 emission transitions are above 40%. The fluorescence of Pr3+ in the visible bands was observed under 325nm pumping. The energy transfer and concentration quenching have been discussed. The 1D2 emission quenches much faster than those of 3P0 due to the cross-relaxation between 1D2â1G4 and 3H4â3F4 transitions, which provides an appropriate interpretation for the red shift of emission band around 600nm. The decay curves of 3P0 level are measured. In 0.5mol% Pr3+ doped sample, we obtained maximum lifetime is 21.5Î¼s. The prepared glasses are potential candidates for laser applications.",1
"In this study, the influence of stacking sequence on mode I delamination resistance (R-curve) behavior of E-glass/epoxy laminated composites with an initial delamination between 0Â°//0Â° interface is experimentally investigated. To this end, symmetric double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens of stacking sequences; [0Â°12]s, [(0Â°/90Â°)3]2s and [0Â°/90Â°/Â±45Â°/90Â°/0Â°]2s with two initial crack lengths are used. A pronounced R-curve behavior is observed on all stacking sequences due to locating delamination between two similar layers. Comparison of R-curve behavior of cross-ply and quasi-isotropic DCB specimens with unidirectional (UD) one reveals the significant effect of the non-dimensional coupling parameter, D c = D 12 2 / D 11 D 22 , on the R-curves. Thus, three main outputs of R-curves could be summarized as; (a) the initiation delamination toughness (G Ic-init) of multidirectional (MD) laminates are much lower than that of UD one, (b) stacking sequence has no effect on the fiber bridging length in DCB specimens, and (c) the greater the D c value of a laminate, the higher the steady-state propagation toughness (G Ic-prop) is.",0
"The elastic modulus of the restorative material is important in restoring endodontically treated teeth. This study aimed to compare the fracture resistance and failure patterns of 90 mandibular molars restored using resin composites with or without fiber posts, with respect to the number of residual cavity walls. Five restoration types were performed corresponding to different wall defects (groups 1-5). Groups were divided in two subgroups corresponding to the use or absence of fiber posts. Teeth were loaded and resistance of specimens was measured as the axial compressive load to cause fracture and macroscopic fracture patterns were observed. One way ANOVA revealed a significant difference in fracture resistance (p < 0.001). Tukey post hoc test also revealed significant differences between groups as samples restored with fiber posts exhibited mostly restorable fractures. It was concluded that the resistance of endodontically treated mandibular molars restored with composite resins is mainly affected by the number of residual walls. Using fiber-reinforced posts optimized fracture patterns.",0
"A theoretical study of the dynamics of the two-level systems (TLS) interacting both, with each other and with âlatticeâ vibrations in glass is presented. The spectrum and damping of the collective excitations is calculated. The frequency dependence and concentration one of phonon lifetimes are analysed. It is shown that one of the collective modes becomes soft signalizing about spin-glass-like phase transition in insulating glass. The theory of resonance phonon scattering by the two-level systems in glass has been developed with taking into account the strong coupling of the TLS with acoustic vibrations and strong interaction between TLS.",0
"A shell/core Co-incorporated LiMn2O4 cathode material was synthesized by a facile modified solâgel process, using highly dispersed Mn3O4 nanoparticles as the Mn source. Structural characterization revealed that the shell layer, which was 5â10nm thick, and composed of spinel LiMn1.83Co0.17O4, grew homogeneously on the spinel LiMn2O4 core with a size of ~50nm. Electrochemical results showed that electrochemical performance of the shell/core cathode material compared favorably with that of the Co-doped LiMn2O4 counterparts. Also its rate capability and cycling performance were apparently superior to those of pristine LiMn2O4 synthesized under the same conditions. The shell/core cathode material exhibited a discharge capacity of 127mAhgâ1 at a current rate of 0.5C (where 1C=148mAgâ1), and retained a capacity of 103mAhgâ1 at 10C, showing 81% capacity retention. After 200 cycles at 1C and 25Â°C, it delivered a capacity of 123mAhgâ1, retaining 98% of its initial capacity. After 100 cycles at 1C and 55Â°C, it showed a capacity of 118mAhgâ1, preserving 94% of its initial capacity. Its excellent electrochemical performance along with the facile synthesis process allowed the shell/core cathode material to serve as a promising cathode for high-performance Li-ion batteries.",0
"Continuous glass fiber (GF) reinforced anionic polyamide-6 (APA6) composites were prepared via in situ ring-opening polymerization of caprolactam monomers. The effects of catalyst content, polymerization temperature and time on the viscosity average molar mass (M v) and degree of crystallinity (X c) were investigated in detail. The final mechanical properties of GF/APA6 composites were also studied. The results indicated that both high molecular weight and the high degree of crystallinity of resin matrix lead to the high mechanical properties of composites. Furthermore, the mechanical test results showed that the composites of plain woven fabric had tensile strength of 434MPa and flexural strength of 407MPa. The morphologies of tensile fracture surfaces of the composites specimens were observed through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The SEM analysis showed that many disorganized nano-fiber crystals appear in the tensile fracture surfaces, which improve the mechanical properties of the matrix resin. The mechanical properties of the composites with different post-heat treatments were further investigated. The mechanical properties of the composites are significantly reduced after quenching treatment, but hardly improved after annealing.",0
"The glassy and glassy-crystalline materials of nominal composition xAgIÂ·(100-x) (0.75Ag2OÂ·0.25P2O5), for 50â¤ x â¤85, were investigated by DSC and XRD methods. For a composition corresponding to x =50 an additional series of DSC scans at different heating rates from 6 to 20Â KÂ·minâ1 was carried out. These measurements revealed the occurrence of three crystallization processes. The systematic shifts of their characteristic temperatures, depending on the heating rates were analyzed using the Kissinger approach. Activation energies of these processes were determined. Their values are 179Â kJ/mol, 156Â kJ/mol and 169Â kJ/mol, respectively.",1
"The optical absorption spectra of a specially prepared zinc phosphate glass (ZnP) were studied as a function of gamma dose. The optical absorption spectra in the wavelength region of 200â800Â nm were recorded for pristine ZnP glass sample and a number of samples exposed to different Î³-doses in the range 100â106Â Gy. The optical energy gap (E g) was determined using Tauc's plot. It was found to be independent of Î³-irradiation up to the dose of 103Â Gy followed by a slow decrease of E g up to 105Â Gy. However, a sharp decrease in optical energy band gap was observed at 106Â Gy. The bulk-etch rates for different Î³-doses were also determined and found to be constant up to the dose of 105Â Gy. On the other hand, there is a 12% increase in the bulk-etch rate for the dose of 106Â Gy.",0
"We present the results of calculations of the partial structure factors and radial distribution functions of liquid Li4Pb at different temperatures. Assuming that this alloy is partially ionic, we have modelled the interionic forces by pairwise potentials that are strongly repulsive at small separations r and electronically screened Coulombic at large r. This model was motivated by the fact that a r dependent âordering potentialâ which exhibits approximately screened Coulombic decay for a large r, can be extracted from the neutron diffraction data for Scc(q) in Li4Pb. Our calculations, which are based on the mean-spherical and the hyper-netted-chain approximations, show that the wave number dependence of the measured concentration structure factor Scc(q) can be reasonably well accounted for by our model with effective electron charges of about 0.5 and â2.0 at the Li and Pb sites, respectively, and an inverse screening length of 1Â·1 Ã â1. These parameters are consistent with values obtained from the ordering potential extracted from experiment. In order to explain the observed temperature dependence of Scc(q) it is necessary to assume that the charge transfer between species decreases with increasing temperature.",0
"The Er-doped Bi2O3-GeO2 glass samples were produced by melt quenching procedure. The obtained glasses were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL) technologies and Raman measurements. Near-infrared (NIR) emission was found at about 1525nm under 808nm laser diode (LD) excitation, and the decay constants were within 1â2ms. The emission intensity increased dramatically with increasing of Er dopant until the Er is up to 2mol%, which was mainly due to the highly increased optical absorption of 808nm. The energy transfer process from Bi to Er ions was discussed. The Er-doped Bi2O3-GeO2 glass could be a good light-emitting material for 1530nm emission.",1
"This study examined the effects of a Sc2O3 sintering aid on the density, microstructure and mechanical properties of SiCâ5vol% ZrB2 composites prepared by hot-pressing. Microstructural studies showed that the addition of Sc2O3 not only caused a decrease in the hot-pressing temperature from 1950 to 1750Â°C by liquid phase sintering, but also resulted in the formation of crystalline Sc4Zr3O12 at the grain boundaries via a reaction with ZrO2 on the surface of the ZrB2 powder. The addition of Sc2O3 produced a fine-grained microstructure with a 43% (430â615MPa) and 20% (3.6â4.3MPam1/2) increase in flexural strength and fracture toughness, respectively, compared to the SiCâZrB2 composite without Sc2O3.",0
"Moisture absorption tests were performed on unidirectional glass/polymer composite materials used in high voltage composite (non-ceramic) insulators. The composites were based on E-glass, high seed count ECR-glass and low seed count ECR-glass fibers with modified polyester, epoxy and vinyl ester resins. The composites were exposed to a moist environment with a relative humidity of 80% at 50 Â°C, and their resistance to moisture absorption in terms of the rate of moisture absorption, maximum moisture content and apparent diffusivities was determined. Moisture absorption in unidirectional composite specimens was also studied numerically in this work using finite element techniques. In particular, the effects of specimen geometry (the edge effect) and specimen orthotropy on moisture absorption by the composites were evaluated. Significant differences in the moisture absorption properties of the composites were found indicating that the effect of moisture on the mechanical and electrical properties of the insulators will depend on the type of composite used. It was shown that the vinyl ester based materials had the most favorable moisture diffusion properties for use in high voltage composite insulator applications. The modified polyester based composites exhibited the worst moisture absorption performance. The epoxy-based materials had adequate rates of absorption, however, these materials did not reach equilibrium and kept slowly taking on more moisture in a non-Fickian manner.",0
"In present work, a novel sensitized ion: Sm3+ activated Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped silica-germanate glasses have been synthesized by melt quenching method. Absorption spectra and mid-infrared photo-luminescence of prepared glasses were characterized and compared in parallel. Quintuple enhancement of ~â¯2.85â¯Âµm emission was achieved successfully in Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped silica-germanate glass with 0.3â¯mol% Sm3+ addition, which also possesses a large stimulated emission cross section (14.9â¯Ãâ¯10â21 cm2). Sensitized effect of Sm3+ and efficient energy transfer (ET) mechanism of Ho3+:5I7âSm3+:6H13/2 in the co-doped silica-germanate glasses were investigated under 980â¯nm laser diode excitation. Moreover, decay profiles of Ho3+:5I7 level were measured to further examine the high ET efficiency ( Î· ) of Ho3+:5I7 to Sm3+:6H13/2, which confirmed the efficient population inversion of Ho3+ ~â2.85âÂµm emission. All results indicate that the Yb3+/Ho3+/Sm3+ tri-doped silica-germanate glass is a promising candidate material for improving the Ho3+ ~â2.85âÂµm fiber laser performance.",1
"In our study, in which waste glass (WG) is considered as coarse aggregates in the concrete, WG was used reduced to 4â16 mm in proportions of 0â60% in the production of PKÃ/B 32.5/R type cement. The effects of WG on workability and strength of the concrete with fresh and hardened concrete tests were analyzed. As a result of the study conducted, WG was determined not to have a significant effect upon the workability of the concrete and only slightly in the reduction of its strength. Waste glass cannot be used as aggregate without taking into account its ASR properties. As for cost analysis, it was determined to lower the cost of concrete productions. Our study was an environmental one in consideration to the fact that WG could be used in the concrete as coarse aggregates without the need for a high cost or rigorous energy.",0
"A review of some long-standing problems, as well as some new theoretical results regarding non-Debye relaxation and the glass transition is given. The question of whether a phase transition below (or above) the glass transition temperature, T g, exists is considered. The result that the glass transition temperature and jumps in the dynamic heat capacity and volume expansion coefficient can be calculated if the relevant frequency-dependent linear response functions are known makes the question of the origin of non-Debye relaxation even more important. In effective medium theories, certainly valid at high temperatures, non-Debye relaxation is apparently due to dynamic effects of interactions. At lower temperatures, energy disorder is larger compared with kT, and percolation-based theories may be more appropriate. The question as to the actual magnitude of disorder in energies cannot be conclusively resolved at this time. Certainly, it has been shown that systems exist in which non-Debye relaxation is due exclusively to disorder but, in many systems, an important component of the energy disorder is a manifestation of the influence of topological disorder on interactions. Thus, in these systems, an increase in the magnitude of dynamic interactions relative to kT accompanies the increase in the disorder. The question as to whether universal properties imply universality in the mechanism of non-Debye relaxation is explored in some depth. The present article reaches the tentative conclusion that the relative importance of âdisorderâ and âinteractionsâ may be dependent on the type of glass considered, and possibly even on specific systems. Certainly, the relative importance of dynamic interaction effects increases as the frequency of an applied âforceâ is reduced. If their respective influences âcrossoverâ in importance at some finite frequency, Ïâ, the relevant question is whether Ïâ is above, at, or below the relaxation peak frequency, Ïâ. If universality exists, it relates to the role of disorder, but such a conclusion would require that Ïâ â¤ Î± c always, the generality of which has not been established.",0
"Glasses activated with Eu3+ ions are attractive as luminescent materials for various photonic applications. Co-doping with copper has been proposed for enhancing material optical properties, but the quenching effect of Cu2+ impurities on Eu3+ emission in glass remains largely unexplored. In this work, Eu2O3/CuO-containing bariumâphosphate glasses have been prepared by the melt-quench method, and the Eu3+ photoluminescence (PL) quenching resulting from Eu3+ âCu2+ energy transfer was evaluated. Optical absorption spectroscopy showed that with the increase in CuO concentration the Cu2+ absorption band resonant with Eu3+ emission (e.g. 5D0 â 7F2 transition around 615nm) developed steadily. As a result, Eu3+ PL was progressively quenched. Evaluation of the quenching constants as a function of temperature in the 298â673K range showed differences basically within experimental error, consistent with a resonant transfer and lack of phonon-assisted processes. Moreover, analysis of the Eu3+ emission decay dynamics revealed a strong correlation between the decay rates and Cu2+ impurity levels. Results imply that for practical applications the levels of Cu2+ in Eu3+/Cu+-activated glasses should be reduced if not removed as these will significantly limit device efficiency.",1
"Composites based on poly(etherimide) matrix (PEI) with nanoscale reinforcements (multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)) and multiscale reinforcements (MWCNTs and Glass Fibers (GFs)) are processed by melt blending. For nanocomposite materials, we demonstrate that addition of MWCNTs (i) significantly improve electrical conductivity of PEI matrix, (ii) do not significantly improve the mechanical properties (young and flexural modulus) but strongly degrades the strain at break. In the case of multiscale composite materials PEI_GF_MWCNT, strain at break increases with the nanofiller content, and the electrical properties are the same than that in the case of nanocomposites. TEM observations are performed at the PEI/GF interfaces and clearly show a preferential location and orientation of MWCNTs along and perpendicularly to the GFs which explain the evolution of the strain at break for the multiscale composite materials.",0
"Ti-based TiâZrâCuâFeâSnâSi bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) free from highly toxic elements Ni and Be were developed as promising biomaterials. The influence of (TiÂ +Â Zr)/Cu ratio on glass-formation, thermal stability, mechanical properties, bio-corrosion resistance, surface wettability and biocompatibility were investigated. In the present Ti-based BMG system, the Ti47Zr7.5Cu40Fe2.5Sn2Si1 glassy alloy exhibited the highest glass forming ability (GFA) corresponding to the largest supercooled liquid region, and a glassy rod with a critical diameter of 3Â mm was prepared by copper-mold casting. The Ti-based BMGs possess high compressive strength of 2014â2185Â MPa and microhardness of 606â613 Hv. Young's modulus of the Ti47Zr7.5Cu40Fe2.5Sn2Si1 glassy alloy was about 100Â GPa, which is slightly lower than that of Tiâ6Alâ4V alloy. The Ti47Zr7.5Cu40Fe2.5Sn2Si1 glassy alloy with high GFA exhibited high bio-corrosion resistance, and good surface hydrophilia and cytocompatibility. The mechanisms for glass formation as well as the effect of (TiÂ +Â Zr)/Cu ratio on bio-corrosion behavior and biocompatibility are discussed.",0
"Er3+-doped glasses are important materials to develop upconvertors, sensors, optical fibers and green solid state lasers. The upconversion and near-infrared transitions in Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped phosphate glasses are studied in this work and an improvement of 45% in the quantum efficiency of the glasses is observed by the addition of 1â¯mol% of Yb2O3. Judd-Ofelt analysis, lifetime of some excited states of Er3+ ions and energy transfer mechanisms are discussed.",1
"Tm3+-Er3+ codoped tellurite glasses were pumped at 650 nm and the up-conversion characteristics of Tm3+ and Er3+ luminescences were investigated. By Er3+ codoping, the Tm3+-460 nm up-conversion luminescence due to the 1D2â3F4 transition was quenched and the Tm3+-480 nm up-conversion luminescence due to the 1G4â3H6 transition was selectively sensitized, due to which the intensity became more than 20 times larger than in the absence of Er3+. Both Tm3+-480 nm and Er3+-550 nm up-conversion luminescence intensities have a maximum in the range where the ratio of Er3+- to Tm3+-content is about two. The result was discussed in the context of the energy transfer efficiency calculated from the lifetime of the Er3+:4I 13 2 level, the competition between the excited state absorption efficiency of Tm3+:1G4â3F4 and the ground state absorption of Er3+:4F 9 2 â4I 15 2 estimated from the Judd-Ofelt analyses, and the concentration quenching of the Er3+:4S 3 2 level, mainly due to the cross relaxation. It is concluded that the small optimum ratio of the donor- to acceptor-content (â 2) should be ascribed to the specific mechanisms in the present sensitized up-conversion.",1
"Trivalent europium ions doped single and mixed alkali fluoro tungsten tellurite glasses have been prepared via melt quenching method and characterized by using Raman, optical absorption, excitation, emission and time resolved spectral measurements to understand their utility in visible red emission. Raman spectrum is used to identify different functional groups present in the as prepared glasses. The optical absorption spectra recorded for all the glasses show six bands corresponding to the transitions 7F0â6D2, 7F0â6D1, 7F1â6D1, 7F0â6D0, 7F0â7F6, and 7F1â7F6. An excitation spectrum is used to measure the electron-phonon coupling strength âgâ and phonon energy of the glass host âhÏâ. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra measured under 464Â nm excitation show eight luminescence peaks related to the transitions 5D1â7F0 (509Â nm), 5D1â7F1 (537Â nm), 5D1â7F2 (556Â nm), 5D0â7F0 (580Â nm), 5D0â7F1 (592Â nm), 5D0â7F2 (614Â nm), 5D0â7F3 (652Â nm) and 5D0â7F4 (701Â nm) in all the glasses under investigation. Utilizing the Judd-Ofelt (J-O) parameters evaluated from the PL spectra, various radiative properties have been evaluated. From the decay spectra, experimental lifetimes were measured which are in turn used to evaluate the quantum efficiencies and non-radiatve decay rates in the as prepared glasses. The branching ratios, stimulated emission cross-section, quantum efficiency, colour co-ordinates and confocal images captured to confirm the suitability of these glasses for visible red luminescent devices.",1
"Ternary Se90Te10âx Pb x with (x=2 and 6at% ) glass compositions have been prepared using a melt quenching technique and performed the non-isothermal kinetics by differential thermal analysis (DTA) at various heating rates. The glassy state of the studied samples has been characterized using x-ray diffraction analysis. The glass transition temperature T g, the onset temperature of crystallization T c and the peak temperature of crystallization T p are found to be composition and heating rate dependent. From heating rate dependence of T g and T p, the glass transition activation energies E g and the crystallization activation energies E c have been determined according to different methods. The transformation mechanisms have been examined by the values of Avrami exponent n and dimensionality of growth m. Thermal stability and glass formation ability have been monitored through the calculation of the thermal stability S, temperature difference ÎT, Hurby parameter H r, frequency factor K o, crystallization rate factor K and fragility index F. The compositional dependence of the aboveâmentioned parameters indicate that, the stability of the studied glass samples decreases with increasing Pb at% content.",1
"To understand the mechanism of the âhybrid effectâ on the tensile properties of hybrid composites, single fiber type and hybrid microcomposites were fabricated by using Kevlar-149 as the low elongation fiber and S glass fibers as the high elongation fiber, in a DER 331/DER 732 epoxy mixture (70/30, w/w). Kevlar-149 fiber showed a significantly higher tensile strength in the microcomposite than as a single filament. For the hybrid, Kevlar-149 fibers usually broke one by one. A positive hybrid effect for the failure strain but a negative hybrid effect for the strength of the hybrid were observed. Tensile strength of the microcomposites predicted by Monte Carlo simulation agreed with the experimental results reasonably well. The tensile modulus of the hybrid followed the rule of mixture. The fiber/matrix interface properties were investigated by using single fibre pull-out from a microcomposite (SFPOM) test, which showed a significant difference between the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of Kevlar fiber/epoxy in single-fiber type (SFT) and that in the hybrid at a constant fiber volume fraction, which shortened the ineffective length and contributed to the failure strain increase of Kevlar-149 fibers in the hybrid.",0
"This study investigates the potential of the use of recycled glass powder in foam concrete as a sustainable solution for future construction. The effects of cement and recycled glass powder contents, water to cement ratio and volume of foam on the plastic density, dry density, and compressive strength of foam concrete were investigated. The compressive strength of foam concrete without and with recycled glass powder increased with the increase in the plastic density and dry density of foam concrete. The direct replacement of cement with recycled glass powder (20% by mass) increased the compressive strength of foam concrete.",0
"The calorimetric glass transition behaviour in the amorphous forms of water is reviewed: for a heating rate of 30 K minâ1 the onset temperature, or Tg, of the glass transition is 136Â±1 K for hyperquenched glassy water and annealed vapour-deposited amorphous solid water, and 129Â±1 K for the low-density form of pressure-amorphized hexagonal ice. The increase in heat capacity in the glass transition region is between 1.6â2 J Kâ molâ for the three amorphous forms. Annealing of the samples a few degrees below Tg or heating several degrees above the glass transition region has no influence on the onset temperatures at 136 K and 129 K respectively, which is contrary to ânormalâ behaviour. The results are discussed with respect to the âstructureâ of the three amorphous forms of water below the glass transition region and a âgel-likeâ state of water above Tg.",0
"Laser welding-brazing of TC4 Titanium (Ti) alloy to 304 stainless steel (SS) has been applied using 38Zn-61Cu (wt%) alloy as filler metal. A new welding process for SS-Ti alloy joint was introduced on the basis of the controlling the formation of Ti-Fe intermetallics in the joint. One process was one pass welding involving creation of a joint with one fusion weld and one brazed weld separated by remaining unmelted SS. When laser beam on the SS side was 1.5â¯mm, SS would not be completely melted in joint. Through heat conduction, the filler metal melted occurred at the SS-Ti alloy interface. A brazed weld was formed at the SS-Ti alloy interface with the main microstructure of (Fe, Zn)â¯+â¯Fe3Zn7, Î²-CuZn and Î²-CuZnâ¯+â¯Ti2Zn3. The joint fractured at the brazed weld with the maximum tensile strength of 210â¯MPa.",0
"A large tensile plastic deformation was achieved in ZrCu-based metallic glass composites with a metastable B2 phase. It was found that the B2 phase can effectively promote the density of the stress concentration sites and enhance the formation and interaction of multiple shear bands, which significantly stabilize the tensile plastic deformation of metallic glass composites. Based on the concept of the normalized strain-hardening rate, the critical volume fraction for the stable tensile plastic deformation of metallic glass composites was determined.",0
"SiO2âSrB4O7:Eu2+ glassâceramic thin films were fabricated for possible application in near ultraviolet (NUV) emitting devices. Nano-sized SrB4O7:Eu2+ powders were prepared by a Pechini-type solâgel method and a subsequent ball-milling treatment. The powders showed NUV emissions centered at 367nm, upon irradiation with UV of shorter wavelengths, due to an allowed 4f 65d 1 â4f 7 electronic transition of Eu2+ ions. The glassâceramic thin films were prepared by dip-coating of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) solutions dispersed with the nano-sized SrB4O7:Eu2+ powders and a subsequent heat-treatment. It was found that the glassâceramic thin films had relatively high thermal stability up to 800Â°C in terms of the Eu2+ emissions. SiO2 layers surrounding SrB4O7:Eu2+ appeared to be effective for the surface passivation of the phosphor particles.",1
"Ti-based bulk metallic glasses have attracted lots of attention of scientific researchers due to their lightweight, low cost and high specific strength. But only a few Ti-based alloys have been reported possessing large glass forming ability. Then, research on new Ti-based alloys with good glass forming ability is necessary and important. In present work, rods of Ti43.15Zr9.59Cu36.24Ni9.06Sn1.96 glassy alloy with diameter of 3Â mm have been fabricated by using copper mould casting method. It has been found that this Ti-based bulk metallic glass possesses good mechanical properties at room temperature. The compressive yield strength and the fracture strength of the glassy alloy are 2360Â MPa and 2640Â MPa, respectively, together with the plastic strain of 2.24%. The present results show that adding an element or increasing the amount of an element with large difference in atomic size ratio with other main constitutive elements and more negative mixing heat with other main constitutive elements in an alloy would benefit to enhance the glass forming ability of the alloy.",0
"We report on effect of Ce3+ co-doping on the downconversion luminescence in Tb3+âYb3+ co-doped borate glasses. The luminescence properties of glasses singly doped and co-doped with Ce3+, Tb3+ and Yb3+ have been investigated. After co-doping with Ce3+ in the Tb3+âYb3+ doped glasses, the near-infrared energy transfer involving the 2F5/2 â 2F7/2 emission of Yb3+ (about 960â1040nm) is achieved, along with eight times stronger luminescence of Tb3+: 5D4 â 7F3â5 transition. The possible mechanism of the downconversion energy transfer phenomenon was discussed. The enhancement of visible and near-infrared luminescence can improve the photovoltaic energy conversion efficiency of solar cells.",1
"The microstructure and mechanical properties of extruded MgâSn alloys with 6â10%Sn were investigated. Tensile and compressive strengths increased and yield asymmetry reduced with Sn addition. These changes are attributed to grain refinement and fine Mg2Sn precipitates. However, Mgâ10%Sn alloy showed relatively poor tensile ductility due to the presence of coarse particles.",0
"By now, various accelerators have been used to accelerate the chemical reactions between cement and water to achieve a desired strength. This study investigates the effects of diethanolamine (DEA) as a less corrosive accelerator on the setting time and mechanical properties of fibre reinforced shotcrete (FRS). Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) was also used to improve the flexural and tensile strengths of shotcrete. In total, 76 different mix designs were prepared and tested to determine the setting time, flexural and tensile strength of shotcrete. The mixes were designed based on three influential parameters including GFRP, water/cement (w/c) ratio and the amount of DEA. According to the results, the flexural and tensile strengths of all specimens increased by adding 0.5% of the weight of GFRP. However, both tensile and flexural strengths showed an insignificant reduction by adding DEA to the mixes. The tensile and flexural strengths of specimens decreased slightly by adding DEA in the presence of GFRP. At a certain amount of DEA, the setting time increased twice with increasing the w/c ratio. The results showed a reduction in the shotcrete strength by using DEA. Thus, in the case where both the setting time and shotcrete strength are of great importance, the optimal DEA level is close to 0.3% of the dry weight of cement and 0.5% GFRP.",0
"Cr and Nd co-doped glasses are potential gain media for solar pumped lasers (SPLs). Tanabe-Sugano analysis shows that Cr doped Si-B-Na-Al-Ca-Zr-O (SBNACZ) glass contains a mixture of Cr3+ with octahedral coordination and Cr6+with unknown coordination. The crystal field parameters for Cr3+ were Dqâ¯=â¯1574 cmâ1, Bâ¯=â¯792.2 cmâ1, Câ¯=â¯3005 cmâ1 and Dq/Bâ¯=â¯1.99, indicating a low covalency of Cr-O bonds. We compared the quantum efficiency (QE) of Nd and Cr co-doped SBNACZ glass with Nd doped SBNACZ glass to determine the Cr3+âNd3+ transfer QE. The Cr2O3 content was fixed at 0.1â¯mol.% and the Nd2O3 content was varied between 0.1 and 1â¯mol.%. A maximum transfer QE of 20% was obtained at 0.5â¯mol.% Nd2O3. Cr3+âNd3+ energy transfer is dominated by the coulombic interaction mechanism. The clustering of Nd3+ was a limiting factor for increasing the transfer QE with higher Nd3+ concentrations.",1
"The effect of fiber sizing and surface texture on the strength and energy absorbing capacity of fiber reinforced composites has been evaluated at two length scales using the macromechanical quasi-static punch shear test and the micromechanical microdroplet test methods. E-Glass/SC-79 epoxy composite laminates with four different fiber sizing formulations with various degrees of chemical bonding and surface texture have been investigated. The failure modes during perforation and different energy dissipating damage mechanisms were identified and quantified. The punch shear strength and the total energy absorption per unit volume of composite with hybrid sizing have increased by 48% and 100% over the incompatible sizing. These results showed linear correlations with the interphase properties reported earlier by the authors (Gao et al., 2011) and provided a methodology for developing new sizing by tailoring chemical bonding and the fiber surface texture at the fiberâmatrix interphase for improving both strength and energy absorption of composites.",0

"In the present study, a novel dendrite-composite high-entropy alloy consisting of nano-structured interdendritic regions and coarse dendrites was successfully designed and prepared by arc-melting. Interestingly, the as-cast Al18Fe33.3Co23Ni23C2.7 (at. %) alloy exhibited a great combination of high compressive strength and strain. More importantly, the new material exhibited pronounced three-stage work-hardening behavior. It was found that deformation twinning in the interdendritic region is the dominant mechanism responsible for the multi-stage work-hardening, thereby leading to good compression behavior of the new material. The synergistic effects between the dendrite and interdendritic regions are also effective for improving the mechanical property of the alloy.",0
"To explore the application potential of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) as energetic structural materials (ESMs) and address the limitations in the preparation of large-sized monolithic BMGs, the effect of the in-situ crystalline phases on the mechanical properties and energy release behaviors of Zr55Ni5Al10Cu30 BMGs are evaluated. The results indicate that while the content of in-situ crystalline phases in Zr55Ni5Al10Cu30 alloy are effectively tailored by controlling the cooling rate of molten alloys, the mechanical properties and energy release behaviors of Zr55Ni5Al10Cu30 are determined by the content of in-situ crystalline phases. The alloy prepared using the highest cooling rate possesses the lowest crystalline phase content as well as the highest strength and deformability. By contrast, the complete crystalline alloy prepared by annealing exhibits the highest energy release characteristics under high-speed impact owing to the highest degree of brittleness and most oxidation reaction. The Zr55Ni5Al10Cu30 alloy with different crystalline phase content shows potential as an ESM. Its mechanical properties and energetic characteristics can be effectively tailored by controlling the content of in-situ crystalline phases via cooling rate modulation.",0
"In this research, a novel application for graphitic carbon nitride as the sintering aid and reinforcement was investigated. In this regard, g-C3N4 doped ZrB2-based ultrahigh temperature ceramic was fabricated by route of spark plasma sintering at 1850â¯Â°C under an applied pressure of 40â¯MPa for 6â¯min. Microstructure development, sinterability, and mechanical properties were studied and compared to the additive-free ZrB2. The sinterability was remarkably enhanced, and a fully-dense ceramic was obtained by addition of 5â¯wt% g-C3N4, in comparison with the monolithic ZrB2 with a relative density of 76.5%. The elimination of oxide surface impurities of ZrB2 (B2O3 and ZrO2) through chemical reactions with g-C3N4 and the formation of in-situ phases like ZrC and BN were confirmed by microstructural and phase analyses. Mechanical properties were enhanced with a small amount of g-C3N4 additive due to the densification improvement and prevention of grain growth. The values of hardness, indentation fracture toughness and flexural strength increased from 10.1â¯GPa, 1.9â¯MPaâ¯mÂ½ and 187.6â¯MPa for monolithic ZrB2 to 16.2â¯GPa, 5.4â¯MPaâ¯mÂ½ and 516.4â¯MPa for g-C3N4 doped ZrB2 ceramic.",0
"In this paper, we report the development of a glass fiber commingled composite (GFCC) based on a nanoclay-doped polyamide 6 (PA6) and the evaluation of its fire reaction. The preparation of the composite comprised several steps. Firstly, the nanoclay was dispersed in the PA6 matrix. Then, the produced compound was spun in filaments and commingled with continuous glass fibers. Finally, the laminate preform was consolidated. Reference samples based on the neat PA6 were produced as well. As a results, although it is well known that, in the presence of a relevant amount of continuous fibers, the behavior of the material is mainly driven by the fibers themselves (e.g. mechanical, thermal, conductive, and so on), the effect of the clay was interesting, especially in flammability test (UL94 vertical burning test), where the total burning time passes from 227Â s to 146Â s.",0
"In this study, the impact behavior of laminated glassâepoxy composites at several temperatures (20Â°C, â20Â°C and â60Â°C) was studied experimentally. Impact tests were performed by using Fractovis Plus impact test machine with a constant impactor mass of 5.02kg. Composite specimens with stacking sequence [0/90/45/â45] S were impacted at varied impact energies ranging from 5J to 70J. Variation of the impact characteristics such as maximum contact load, maximum deflection, maximum contact time and absorbed energy versus impact energy are depicted in figures. Results indicated that the ambient temperature highly affects the impact response of composite materials.",0
"Metal (Au, Ag) nanoparticles (M NPs) (ca. 30â40Â nm) prepared by citrate reduction method were arrayed on amine-terminated glass substrates using diamine linkers with different chain lengths. 1,4-diaminobutane (C-4 diamine) produced the uniform and densely-packed array of M NPs on glass substrates at appropriate concentration ranges, whereas diamine linkers with longer chain lengths (C-8 and C-12 diamines) produced more heterogeneous and aggregated array of M NPs. When compared to Ag NPs, Au NPs demonstrated more controllable and higher packing density due to their mono-dispersed size and higher affinity to diamine linkers. Uniformly arrayed M NPs (Au, Ag) on glass substrates exhibited high enhancement factors in SERS measurements of o-chlorothiophenol probes. Au NPs arrayed substrates exhibited an approximate power-law linearity of Raman intensity with probe concentrations (from 10â7Â M to 10â4Â M), demonstrating more reliable SERS substrates than Ag arrayed substrates with higher SERS activity.",0
"Sm3+, Eu3+ and Tb3+ doped borate glass is investigated for its potential as light converting phosphor for solid-state lighting applications. Concentration-dependent luminescence, quantum efficiency and radiative lifetimes are analysed. The luminescence quantum efficiency exceeds values of more than 80%. Cross-relaxation processes in the single-doped glasses result in luminescence quenching for Sm3+ with increasing doping level, whereas for Eu3+ and Tb3+ an increase is observed. In Sm3+/Eu3+ and Tb3+/Eu3+ double-doped glass the energy transfer processes between the rare-earth ions are investigated in detail. The colour coordinate of the Tb3+/Eu3+ double-doped glass can be shifted from the green to the red spectral range by changing the Tb3+-to-Eu3+ ratio in favour of Eu3+. In addition, double doping allows for a change in colour coordinate by using different excitation wavelengths.",1
"This paper reports on the near infrared (730â783 nm) to the visible upconversion emissions at 482 nm (4F9/2â6H15/2), 576 nm (4F9/2â6H13/2) and 662 nm (4F9/2â6H11/2) from the Dy3+doped 53ZrF4â20BaF2â2LaF3â2YF3â3AlF3â19NaFâ1DyF3 glasses. We have also carried out a systematic study on the normal emission properties of these glasses in order to understand their performance both as a NIR upconverted visible luminescent and as normal visible fluorescent optical systems of technical importance. With an increase in Dy3+ concentration beyond a particular value (1mol%), activatorâactivator interaction becomes a significant cause of concentration quenching in the luminescence properties. The dependence of the emission spectra on the excitation wavelengths has also been examined and 451 nm was found to be the ideal excitation wavelength in the measurement of normal fluorescence spectra. In the case of NIR upconverted visible emission, we have observed that the NIR excitation at 783 nm as the suitable pump wavelength in demonstrating prominent visible emission colours from these glasses. The relevance in undertaking these optical materials lies in their potential for upconversion laser application in the visible wavelength region. The NIR upconversion phenomenon has been explained in terms of energy level schemes due to excited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer upconversion (ETU) processes.",0
"An 8 (wt.) % yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating isothermally oxidized in air at 1100â¯Â°C for up to 3000â¯h was investigated by means of indentation and electron microscopy analyses. It is found that the growth kinetics of thermally grown oxides followed a parabolic law. The apparent porosity within the coatings decreased after isothermal oxidation. The tetragonal prime YSZ phase transformed into cubic and then monoclinic phases during isothermal oxidation. Elastic modulus, microhardness and fracture toughness of the coating increased as oxidation duration prolonged. The correlation between microstructural variation and mechanical properties was discussed.",0
"A charge-density-wave (CDW) ground state that exists in Nb3Te4 below 115 K is not observed in the isostructural and isoelectronic Nb3Se4 and Nb3S4. Intercalating indium into Nb3Se4 induces a Peierls transition to a CDW ground state near 35 K judging by a peak in the resistivity. The onset temperature of this resistance peak is influenced by the mole fraction intercalated. Electron diffraction (ED) evidence supports these findings. In contrast, intercalating Nb3S4 with indium does not produce a resistivity peak above â¼12 K to suggest the presence of a CDW ground state. An electron diffraction study has linked complex superlattice satellites (SLS) near 90 K in both chalcogenides to a CDW transition but the present resistivity results suggest that this is not the case. A number of other guests intercalated into either chalcogenide do not produce any resistivity features to suggest a Peierls transition. A CDW does, however, appear to exist in Ga1.0Nb3Te4 and provides support for an apparent synergism between group III metals intercalated into Nb3Te4 and Nb3Se4 and the existence of a CDW ground state. Pulsed resistivity measurements of In1.0Nb3Se4 at 12 K with fields to â¼20 V/cm indicate that the electrical transport remains ohmic.",1
"We have made a series of gradient-corrected relativistic full-potential density-functional calculations for Ca-substituted and hole-doped SrRuO3 in para, ferro, and A-, C-, and G-type antiferromagnetic states. Magnetic phase-diagram data for Sr1âx Ca x RuO3 at 0K are presented. Neutron diffraction measurements combined with total energy calculations show that spin-glass behavior with short-range antiferromagnetic interactions rules in CaRuO3. The substitution of Sr by Ca in SrRuO3 decreases the ferromagnetic interaction and enhances the G-type antiferromagnetic interaction; the G-AF state is found to stabilize around x=0.75 consistent with experimental observations. Inclusion of spinâorbit coupling is found to be important in order to arrive at the correct magnetic ground state in ruthenates.",0
"Eu3+-doped glass-ceramics (GC) containing NaCaPO4 crystals were successfully fabricated via traditional melt-quenching route with further heat-treatment. The structure of NaCaPO4 crystals was confirmed by X-ray diffraction technique. Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) and optically stimulated luminescence in continuous wave modality (CW-OSL) properties were investigated for potential applications in radiation measurements. The PL excitation and emission spectra exhibited transitions related to Eu3+ ions corresponding to the strongest excitation and emission wavelengths at 395 and 619â¯nm, respectively. The CW-OSL intensity reached a maximum when the Eu2O3 concentration was 0.25â¯mol%. Doping the material with abundant Eu2O3 shows concentration quenching. The NaCaPO4 GC exhibited high sensitivity to ionizing radiation, Low-Z (Zeffâ¯ââ¯10.16) and a broad linear dose response range (0.02â1000â¯Gy).",1
"This work concerns the production by vacuum infusion and the comparison of the properties of different hybrid composite laminates, based on basalt fibre composites as the inner core, and using also glass, flax and hemp fibre laminates to produce symmetrical configurations, all of them with a 21â23% fibre volume, in an epoxy resin. The laminates have been subjected to tensile, three-point flexural and interlaminar shear strength tests and their fracture surfaces have been characterised by scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical performance of all the hybrid laminates appears superior to pure hemp and flax fibre reinforced laminates and inferior to basalt fibre laminates. Among the hybrids, the best properties are offered by those obtained by adding glass and flax to basalt fibre reinforced laminates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of hybrid laminates showed the diffuse presence of fibre pull-out in hemp and flax fibre reinforced layers and a general trend of brittle failure.",0
The connection between the Rayleigh line wing in inelastic light scattering spectra in liquids and the boson peak observed at light scattering in glasses in the frequency range of 20â100 cmâ1 has been found for the first time. The Rayleigh line wing is represented as a sum of boson and central peaks. The obtained results are evidence of the existence of structural correlations in high-viscosity liquid which decrease exponentially with the distance on the scale of 10 Ã .,1
"Local dynamics of cis-1, 4-polybutadiene near the glass transition temperature T g (=170K) has been investigated by quasielastic neutron scattering in the energy range of 0.01 meV to 10meV. It was found that two models of motions appear near the T g in the energy range of ca. 1 meV and 10 â½ 30 Î¼eV. The fast mode arises ca. 50 K below T g which corresponds to the so-called Vogel temperature T 0. On the other hand, the slow mode appears just above T g. The natures of the two modes are discussed from viewpoints of glass transition.",0
"In this Letter we present a promising trivalent-ytterbium-doped GeO2âTeO2âNb2O5âBaO laser glass with better laser performance parameters and emission properties. It is shown that with increasing glass modifier (BaO) content, spectroscopic properties of activator in this glass such as absorption cross section, integrated absorption area and emission cross section decrease, and with increasing GeO2/TeO2 ratio the highest value of emission properties appear near 30Â mol% GeO2. Compared to all the ytterbium-doped laser glasses reported in published papers, the present glass has much higher gain parameter and lower minimum pump intensity. The better emission and laser properties may make this glass become promising candidate gain medium for high power solid state lasers.",1
"The behavior of a concrete structure at elevated temperatures is one of the vital areas of concern in civil engineering. Because high temperatures cause adverse effects on the mechanical and durability properties of concrete structures, finding solutions to improve these properties at various temperatures is important. This study goes to indicate the effects of steel and glass fiber addition on the behavior of normal concrete at high temperatures. The mechanical and durability specifications were tested at elevated temperatures, and after cooling, respectively. The volume fraction of fibers is 0.25%, and measurements are conducted at temperatures ranging from 28Â Â°C to 800Â Â°C. The results indicate that the application of steel fibers improves the compressive, tensile, and shear strength in a range of 9â27%, 8â198%, and 1â22% at high temperatures, respectively. For specimens containing glass fiber, the level of compressive and tensile strength improvement is in the range of 1â18% and 19â213%, respectively. Although the durability tests show that high temperatures can damage the durability properties of concrete, the addition of fibers has compensated for this damage. Meanwhile, it is observed that the sorptivity and penetration depth of water tests due to the capillary properties has a similar result.",0
"The effects of Beryllium (Be) on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Alâ15%Mg2Si composite were investigated. The results showed that with the increase of Be content, the average size and volume fraction of primary Mg2Si particles decreases. Pseudo-eutectic Mg2Si has mainly a fine fibrous structure in both specimens with and without Be. However, in the samples containing Be, the path for crack propagation along cell boundaries is very tortuous. Meanwhile, Î²AlâMgâBe phase based on a Î²-Al3Mg2 phase of the AlâMg system was observed in specimens containing Be. It was found that with the addition of Be the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation values improved. A study of the specimen's fracture surfaces via scanning electron microscope revealed that Be increases the number of fine dimples and decohered Mg2Si particles.",0
The effect of moisture on the glass-coupling agent and coupling agent-resin interface was investigated. The findings were related to the performance of the epoxy glass reinforced laminate.,0
"RÃ©sumÃ© Tout torticolis de lâenfant doit faire rechercher une origine traumatique. Dâautres Ã©tiologies peuvent Ãªtre en cause. Les auteurs rapportent un cas de pseudoluxation rotatoire atloÃ¯do-axoÃ¯dienne (PRAA) mÃ©dicamenteuse chez un enfant. LâanamnÃ¨se retrouvait la notion dâune chute avec traumatisme crÃ¢nien le matin mÃªme suivie de cÃ©phalÃ©es. La clinique notait une rotation cervicale droite irrÃ©ductible douloureuse, une hyperreflexie ostÃ©otendineuse. Un aspect de Â« luxation Â» C1-C2 sans lÃ©sion traumatique Ã©tait rÃ©vÃ©lait par la tomodensitomÃ©trie du rachis cervical. En quelques heures, le torticolis sâest rÃ©duit spontanÃ©ment puis est rÃ©apparu Ã gauche. Cette fluctuation clinique associÃ©e Ã la prise de mÃ©toclopramide (PrimpÃ©ranÂ®) initiÃ©e plus tÃ´t pour une gastroentÃ©rite aiguÃ« faisait porter le diagnostic de PRAA. Cette entitÃ©, confirmÃ©e par une Ã©volution clinicoradiologique favorable, est favorisÃ©e par lâhyperlaxitÃ© ligamentaire de la jonction crÃ¢niorachidienne de lâenfant. Lâanalyse de lâimagerie et la recherche systÃ©matique de causes toxiques ont permis dâen faire le diagnostic. Torticollis in children must always instigate a search for trauma. Many other etiologies can be found. The authors report a case of postmedicinal atlantoaxial rotatory pseudoluxation (AARP) occurring in a child. This child had fallen down in the morning with head trauma followed by headache. Clinically, a stiff neck with an irreducible right rotation of his neck, and an osteotendinous hyperreflexia were noted. There was a C1-C2 rotatory dislocation with no traumatic lesion on the cervical CT scan. After a few hours, the torticollis spontaneously reduced and then reappeared on the left side. This clinical fluctuation and the absorption of metoclopramide (PrimpÃ©ranÂ®) started in the morning for acute gastroenteritis provided the diagnosis of AARP. This entity was confirmed by the good clinical and radiological follow-up and was caused by the substantial ligament laxity of the craniovertebral junction encountered in children. The analysis of medical imaging and the systematic search for a medicinal cause helped make the right diagnosis.",0
"A spectroscopic study based on photoluminescence spectra and decay time profiles in Tm3+ and Tm3+/Dy3+ doped Zn(PO3)2 glasses is reported. The Tm3+ doped Zn(PO3)2 glass, upon 357Â nm excitation, exhibits blue emission with CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates, xÂ =Â 0.157 and yÂ =Â 0.030, and color purity of about 96%. Under excitations at 348, 352 and 363Â nm, which match with the emissions of AlGaN and GaN based LEDs, the Tm3+/Dy3+ co-doped Zn(PO3)2 glass displays natural white, bluish white and cool white overall emissions, with correlated color temperature values of 4523, 10700 and 7788Â K, respectively, depending strongly on the excitation wavelength. The shortening of the Dy3+ emission decay time in presence of Tm3+ suggests that Dy3+âTm3+ non-radiative energy transfer occurs. By using the Inokuti-Hirayama model, it is inferred that an electric quadrupole-quadrupole interaction might be the dominant mechanism involved in the energy transfer. The efficiency and probability of this energy transfer are 0.12 and 126.70Â sâ1, respectively.",1
The shear bond strength of a composite resin bonded to an etched glass ionomer was examined. Results indicate that shear bond strength between the two materials is greater than the cohesive strength of the glass ionomer itself. This property combined with other beneficial properties of glass ionomer materials may lead to their use as bases for composite resin restorations.,0
"Optical properties such as the radiative lifetimes (T m) of the lasing transition 4 F 3 2 â 4 I 11 2 at 1.06 Î¼m, the absorption coefficients (Î²) for the hypersensitive transition ( 4 G 5 2 â 4 I 9 2 ) in the wavelength region 560â590 nm and also certain non-linearity characteristic parameters such as Ï d, Î· 2, Î³ and Ï IIII (3) were determined for eleven newly developed Nd3+-doped chalcogenide glasses. These laser optical materials were significantly influenced in their properties by irradiations carried out with an argon ion laser (488, 514 nm) and a UV source (254 nm).",1
"The mesoporous ATO/MnO2 coreâshell architectures are prepared through a one-pot templated-assembly route. The morphologies and structures of ATO nanoparticles and ATO/MnO2 nanocomposites are examined by focus ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of the ATO/MnO2 nanocomposites electrodes are elucidated by cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The results demonstrate that the ATO/MnO2 nanostructure electrodes exhibit highly reversible features, good specific capacitance (186.8Fgâ1), and good capacitance retention (76.8% over 1000 cycles). Indeed, the ATO nanoparticles provide a high conductivity for coreâshell architectures. These findings indicate the suitability of the low-cost ATO/MnO2 nanocomposites as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.",0
"Glass formation and glass forming ability in the ternary ZrâCuâNi system were studied systematically. For Cu mold casting, the critical size for glass formation was found to be 1mm in a relatively wide composition range of 56â64 at.% Zr, 16â26at.% Cu and 16â24at.% Ni. The phases competing with glass formation were found to be Zr, Zr2Cu and Zr2Ni. Despite the fact that Cu and Ni are completely miscible with each other, they cannot be regarded as simple substitution to each other in the case of glass formation in the ZrâZr2CuâZr2Ni ternary eutectic system.",0
"In the present study a novel of gas multiple-tunnel plasma spraying technology was adopted to fabricate composite coatings with various content of Fe-based metallic glass and ZrO2. By this way the glassy formation ability of the Fe-based metallic glass is not affected, and proportion of the two phases in the composite coatings can be regulated according to design. The tribological test results indicate that the addition of ZrO2 improves the wear resistance. However, the wear rate of the composite coating is nonlinear related to the fraction of ZrO2. There is a transformation from toughness to brittleness with the increase of ZrO2 in the composite coating. Therefore, the wear failure mechanism of the composite coating is changed from abrasive wear to fatigue wear.",0
"Polypropylene and the short glass-fibre-polypropylene composite in the form of granules were each initially pre-mixed with a sodium benzoate nucleating agent in a dry blender and subsequently homogenized in a twin-screw extruder. The extrudate was masticated and compression moulded. The inherent fibre orientation K and the interfacial shear strength Ï of the short glass-fibre-polypropylene composite were determined by use of the short fibre composite theories proposed by Kelly and Tyson and modified by Bowyer and Bader. The interfacial shear strength Ï and orientation factor K values of 18 MPa 0.201 and 24 MPa 0.177 were obtained for the nucleated and the unnucleated composite, respectively. The nucleated composite showed decreased interfacial shear strength and increased orientation factor, as was expected. The interfacial shear strength of the unnucleated samples compared favourably with the literature values.",0
"The superconducting transition and the critical fluctuations of a model system that can pass continuously from one-dimension to three-dimensions are investigated. The transition is brought about by a variable coupling between families of linear chains. First, a Bose lattice-gas is considered, and the Bose-Einstein transition temperature T BE is calculated as a function of the coupling strength. Second, the temperature T oz at which the fluctuations in the gap parameter equal the average gap parameter is calculated as a function of the coupling, and is found to behave in a similar way to T BE . Both these temperatures go continuously to zero as the system becomes one-dimensional while T c calculated in mean-field theory does not vanish in this limit. It is found that for coupling parameters believed to be characteristic of some superconductors possessing the A-15 crystal structure, such as Nb3Sn, the system is essentially three-dimensional (3D) as far as superconducting properties are concerned; but critical fluctuations may be somewhat enhanced, in particular when the electronic density of states is not very large.",0
"The phonon spectrum of a model glass is investigated by classical microcanonical molecular dynamics. The evolution of the shape of the longitudinal and transverse branches is determined as a function of the quenching rate and the aging time. Immediately after the quench, the minimum frequency for both branches, which is located at the pseudo-Bragg peak wave vector, is the lowest for the ideal quenching rate at which the glass is the most stable. When the glass evolves towards a crystalline phase, this minimum frequency increases and then saturates at higher values, as a result of anisotropy.",0
"This paper focuses on understanding the deformation and progressive failure behavior of glass/epoxy plain weave fabric-reinforced laminates subjected to uniaxial tension at cryogenic temperatures. Cryogenic tensile tests were conducted on the woven-fabric laminates, and the damage development during loading was characterized by AE (acoustic emission) measurements. A finite element model for progressive failure analysis of woven-fabric composite panels was also developed, and applied to simulate the âkneeâ behavior in the stressâstrain responses and the damage behavior in the tensile test specimens. Failure of the epoxy resin matrix in the transverse fiber bundle was predicted to occur using the maximum strain failure criterion. The effect of strain concentrations due to the fabric architecture on the failure strain of the material was considered by incorporating the SVF (strain variation factor) from the meso-scale analysis of a woven-fabric composite unit into the macro-scale analysis of the specimens. A comparison was made between the finite element predictions and the experimental data, and the agreement is good.",0
"In the field of photocatalytic air purification, the immobilisation of catalyst particles on support surfaces without loss of photon efficiency is an important challenge. Therefore, an immobilisation method involving a one-step suspension coating of pre-synthesised photocatalysts on glass beads was applied. The various benefits are exemplified in the gas phase photodegradation of ethylene. Coating of glass beads is easy, fast, cheap and offers a more efficient alternative to bulk catalyst pellets. Furthermore, this coating procedure allows to use porous, pre-synthesised catalysts to their full potential, as the surface area and morphology of the initial powder is barely altered after coating, in strong contrast to pelletising. With this technique it became possible to study the gas phase photocatalytic activity of commercial titanium dioxide, trititanate nanotubes and mixed phase anatase/trititanate nanotubes in a packed bed reactor towards the degradation of ethylene without changing the catalyst properties. Coating of glass beads with the photocatalyst revealed the superior activity of the as-prepared nanotubes, compared to TiO2 AerolystÂ® 7710 in gaseous phase.",0
"We have measured the resistive transition and the isothermal currentâvoltage characteristics of an epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7âÎ´ thin film at zero magnetic field. The RâT data above T c can be well described in terms of the classic thermodynamic fluctuation's theory for three-dimensional superconductor. The IâV curves for various temperatures separate two distinct dissipative behaviors in the sample. In low current region, the resistivity is independent on the measuring current increasing, showing ohmic behavior. In higher current region, the IâV curves can be well scaled by vortex-glass theory, indicating current-induced vortex-glass transition. The strong proximity-effect junction was observed in the temperature dependence of the critical current density.",0
"The highest quantum efficiency among amorphous materials was recently observed in the ns2-type Sn2+ activators doped ZnOâP2O5 glass system, which is comparable to the MgWO4 crystal. In this paper, Mn2+/Sn2+-codoped low-melting 44P2O5â36ZnOâ20Li2O (PZL) glasses were prepared by the melt-quenching method to explore blue and red emission materials for greenhouse. Photoluminescence properties of the PZL glasses were investigated systematically by decay curves and absorption, excitation, and emission spectra. The glasses have high optical transparency in the visible region, and can emit intense red light excited at 300, 354, 409, and 505nm. Significantly, upon 300nm excitation, dual blue/red emissions were achieved. Moreover, the ratio of red to blue light could be tuned by adjusting the energy-transfer (ET) of Sn2+âMn2+ through simply adjusting the content of Mn2+. Our research extends the utilization of solar energy in glass greenhouse for plant cultivation.",1
"The Fe-based quaternary bulk metallic glass with critical diameter up to 2.5mm was pinpointed in FeâCoâNbâB system using a strategy for catching the best glass former based on relative glass forming ability of alloys. The best glass former Fe56.04Co13.45Nb5.5B25 exhibits glass transition temperature of 821K, supercooled region of 58K, compressive strength of about 4.5GPa, Vickers hardness of about 13.7GPa, and compressive plastic strain of about 0.6%. The combination of high glass forming ability, high thermal stability, ultrahigh strength and good plasticity makes this alloy of potential applications as a structural material.",0
"We propose that the origin of the VogelâFulcherâTammann law is the increase of the range of elastic interaction between local relaxation events in a liquid. In this picture, we discuss the origin of cooperativity of relaxation, the absence of divergence of relaxation time at a finite temperature and the crossover to a more Arrhenius behavior at low temperature.",0
"Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are non-crystalline metallic alloys, can be fabricated with low cooling rates in many alloy systems. So, it is possible to produce BMGs that are several centimeters thick. BMGs exhibit useful engineering properties of high mechanical strength and high corrosion resistance. In order to extend the engineering application of BMGs, it is necessary to establish appropriate joint process of BMG / BMG and BMG / crystalline metal. In this study, surface treatment using hydrofluoric (HF) solution and copper electroplating were performed and the spread test of the Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu solder was performed to clarify wetting behavior of the solder on electroplated Cu60Zr30Ti10 BMG.",0
"Hot-pressing deformation treatment was carried out at different strain rates and temperatures to improve the microstructure homogeneity of the TiZr-based bulk metallic glass matrix composites (BMGMCs) after enlargement. At a compression strain rate of 0.001/s and temperature of 653â¯K, the TiZr-based BMGMCs exhibited good plastic rheological properties in supercooled liquid region. After work hardening to the peak stress, steady-state flow stress was rapidly obtained, resulting in a stress drop of 223â¯MPa. Moreover, during this period, no rapid stress drop and fracture phenomena were observed. Compared with those of the as-cast morphology, the distribution of dendrite and glass matrix was more homogeneous after 31% thickness reduction in hot-pressing deformation. Accompanied with viscous flow of the glass matrix, the dendrites markedly aggregated together after a thickness reduction ratio of 58%. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that a large amount of dislocations formed in the dendrite, and a large amount of nanocrystals precipitated from the glass matrix after hot-pressing treatment. The amount of the nanoparticles continued to increase as the amount of deformation increased. TiZr-based BMGMCs with 31% compression deformation possessed both the distinguished plastic strain (Îµ p) of 3.95% and ultimate strength (Ï max) of 1595â¯MPa. The stressâstrain curve demonstrated that the rate of stress drop considerably slowed down after tensile strength reached a maximum due to hot-pressing deformation. The rapid expansion of the shear band was efficiently hindered through the combined effect of partial nanocrystallization of the glass matrix and deformation hardening of the dendrite.

"The integration of pseudocapacitive metal oxides with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is considered an innovative chemical strategy to resolve both bottlenecks of pseudocapacitor and electrical double-layer capacitor for high performance supercapacitors. Herein, we report a facile synthesis method of highly porous three-dimensional (3D) CoO/RGO nanocomposite via ozone treatment, ice templating, and thermal annealing. The ozonized RGO surface provides a favorable interaction with cobalt precursor for a stable and uniform deposition of well-defined CoO nanoparticles. The morphology, structure, and chemistry of the resulting CoO/RGO nanocomposites are comprehensively characterized by spectroscopic methods. The CoO/RGO nanocomposites show fast and reversible pseudocapacitance due to a large accessible area, rapid ion transport, and low charge transfer resistance arising from 3D internetworked macroporosity. Thus, the nanocomposites achieve high specific capacitance up to 239.4Fg-1 (volumetric capacitance = 12.04Fcm-3), excellent rate capability of 79.1%, and ultralong cyclic stabilities (of 93.2% at 10Ag-1 even up to 10,000 cycles) in 6M KOH electrolyte. This simple synthesis method offers a promising solution for the design of high performance hybrid energy storage materials consisting of high capacity metal oxides and conductive graphene networks.",0
"Objectives. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of the application of dentin primer and/or dentin bonding agent on the adhesion of a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement to dentin. Methods. Bovine dentin was pretreated with Dentin Conditioner or EDTA 3-2 solution, primed by an experimental dentin primer, and applied with a dentin bonding agent. A resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, Fuji II LC, was then adhered to the dentin. The tensile bond strength between the light-cured glass-ionomer cement and the pretreated dentin was measured. The components of the experimental dentin primers were 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), glyceryl methacrylate (GM) and a water-soluble photo-polymerization initiator, 2-hydroxy-3-(3,4-dimethyl-9-oxo-9H-thioxanthen-2-yloxy)-N,N,N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium chloride (OTX). Significant differences in the data were examined by an analysis of variance and Scheffe's test for multiple comparisons between the means at p=0.05. Results. A significantly higher mean bond strength between the Fuji II LC and dentin was obtained by EDTA 3-2 pretreatment, QTX/GM priming, and LB Bond application. This value was comparable with that obtained with the resin composite system. Scanning electron microscopy observation showed the formation of a hybrid layer with a thickness of 1â1.5Î¼m. Significance. The data obtained in this investigation suggest that the adhesion of Fuji II LC to dentin is closer to that provided by a resin composite system than to that of conventional glass-ionomer cements.",0
"Solarization in glasses is of interest for photosensitive or photoresistant applications. Irradiation induced defects are studied in laser irradiated (248nm) doped NaPO3 Â·2Sr(PO3)2 glasses, and characterized by UVâVIS and EPR-spectroscopy. Solarization decreases from Pb, As, Sb to Sn. The life time of the defects is enhanced in doped compared to undoped glasses. Lead is photoreduced to (Pb2+)â and antimony is photooxidized to (Sb3+)+. EPR signals of an arsenic-related defect are observed and the formation of arsenic-hole centers is deduced from optical spectroscopy. Tin is both photoreduced and photooxidized. An EPR signal at g â¼1.989 is assigned to a âSn3+â analogous defect.",1
"The lead phosphate (LP), xPbOâ(1âx)P2O5 glasses, divided into three compositional regions, x=0.3â0.5 (region I), x=0.55â0.6 (region II), and x=0.66â0.75 (region III) were prepared by single-step melt-quenching process with the melt-temperature increasing from 550 to 750Â°C. The DSC studies on the glasses in the compositional region, which are hygroscopic, revealed two endotherm peaks. The first and weak endotherm around 130Â°C has been attributed to a thermal event in which dehydration of glasses takes place. The second and stronger endotherm has been attributed to the glass transition (T g) phenomenon. The onset of the glass transition temperature was found to increase from about 212Â°C for the glass sample with x=0.3 to about 345Â°C for the glass with x=0.6 in the compositional region II where both crystalline and glass phase co-exist. The observed splitting in the endotherms of glasses in the region II co-relates well with the mixed phase. The gradual and linear increase in the average T g value is consistent with the increase in the melt-temperatures of the glasses and correlates well with increase in the mol% of the modifier PbO in the glasses.",1
"The results of dc magnetization, ac susceptibility, magnetic relaxation, specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements on PrCoRuSi2, an amalgamation of the ferromagnetic compound PrRu2Si2 and the antiferromagnetic compound PrCo2Si2 crystallizing in the same tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure, are reported. The data for this sample reveal spin-glass-like anomalies at the temperature T 0=15K where long-range magnetic ordering sets in. Below T 0, the observed irreversible magnetism, the long-time magnetic relaxation effect as well as the evident upward-shift of the peak temperature of ac susceptibility with increasing frequency are considered to originate, at least partly, from spin-glass-like magnetic frustration due to the competing magnetic interactions.",0
"We report intrinsic memory effect in magnetization for zircon-type DyCrO4, pointing the cooperative glassy response below â¼ 7â¯K. Intriguingly, the memory effect is observed well below the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering temperatures, indicate re-entrant spin-glass state in DyCrO4. Above the magnetic order ferroelectricity emerges with a ferroelectric T C at 97â¯K, which is associated with a signature of magnetoelectric coupling. Thus DyCrO4 attracts the community for multiple interesting properties with a high temperature ferroelectricity and low temperature re-entrant spin-glass-like behavior.",0
"Dy3+ doped multi-component tellurium-borate (MTB) glasses are identified to be an effective phosphor for laser-driven white illumination. Quantitative characterization of absolute spectrum parameter reveals that 2.0â¯wt% Dy2O3 doped MTB glass processes excellent quantum yield as high as 14.42%. The color parameters of white fluorescence are effectively emendated by adjusting the sample size and the pumping power when the preferred doping concentration is determined. The chromaticity parameters including luminous flux, color coordinate and correlated color temperature in 5.48â¯Ãâ¯2.28â¯Ãâ¯2.11â¯cm3 bulk glass phosphor are derived to 3.21â¯lm, (0.350, 0.331) and 4719â¯K closed to the pure-white fluorescence when the excitation power is enhanced to 252.7â¯mW. Effective white fluorescence depended on controllable photon distribution demonstrates that Dy3+ doped MTB glasses have promising application in developing laser-driven white light sources.",1
"The results of dc susceptibility, magnetization, magnetic relaxation and specific heat measurements on U2CuGa3, a compound reported early in the literature as exhibiting interesting magnetic properties, are presented. The temperature dependence of susceptibility measured in the zero-field cooling (ZFC) mode and in the field cooling (FC) mode displays spin-glass behavior below a characteristic temperature T f (â¼16K) in agreement with the literature. As a new evidence for the formation of spin-glass state in this compound, the specific heat data do not show any visible singularity around T f indicating the absence of long-range magnetic order at this temperature. Furthermore, the characteristic remanence effect and magnetic relaxation on a macroscopic time scale are also observed below T f. The experimental results are compared with those of orthorhombic CeCu2-type spin-glass compound U2AuGa3 and hexagonal AlB2-type spin-glass compound U2PdSi3.",0
"Glasses having composition 20ZnOÂ·xBi2O3Â·(79.5â x)B2O3Â·0.5Pr6O11 were prepared by melt quench technique. The amorphous nature of the prepared glass samples was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The spectroscopic properties of these glasses were investigated by recording optical absorption and fluorescence spectra. The structural investigations of the glasses were carried out by recording the IR spectra. The optical properties of Pr3+ ions doped zinc borate glasses with varying concentration of bismuth oxide have been studied. The JuddâOfelt intensity parameters Î© Î» (Î» =2, 4, 6) and other radiative properties like radiative transition probability, radiative life time, branching ratio and stimulated emission cross-section of the prepared glasses have been calculated. The variation of Î© 2 with Bi2O3 content has been attributed to changes in the asymmetry of the ligand field at the rare earth ion site and to the changes in their rare earth oxygen (RE-O) covalency. The branching ratio for 3P0 â 3F2 transition is 42% and the predicted spontaneous radiative transition probability rates are fairly high (14,347â14,607sâ1). This is beneficial for lasing emission. The stimulated emission cross-section for all the emission bands has been calculated.",1
"The new ternary selenide Cr4TiSe8 crystallises in the V5S8 type structure. The determination of the metal atom distribution over the three crystallographically independent sites using neutron scattering experiments reveals that the Ti atoms exclusively occupy the sites within the full metal atom layers with a pronounced preference for one of the two possible sites. The magnetic properties in the high temperature region exhibit CurieâWeiss behaviour with a paramagnetic Curie temperature Î¸ of â300(5)Â K indicating strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Between about 100 and 300 K the susceptibility data pass a very broad maximum and a qualitatively explanation is presented that base on antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between Cr atoms forming linear trimers, dimers, or Cr atoms being isolated. Below about 50Â K the zero field cooled and field cooled susceptibility curves diverge suggesting spin glass behaviour. In the low temperature neutron diffraction patterns no additional peaks are observed which gives further evidence for the occurrence of a spin glass. Below 120Â K the background of the diffraction patterns becomes modulated due to the short range magnetic interactions with sizes of the domains ranging from about 15 to 38Â Ã . Low temperature single crystal X-ray investigations show a remarkable change of the contraction of the lattice parameters below about 220 K that may be due to the onset of the strong magnetic exchange interactions.",0
"The effect of the cooling slope on the structure of Zr-based metallic glass matrix composites was investigated by changing the cooling slope. The synthesis of bulk metallic glass composites was made by a process combining cooling slope casting and Cu mold casting for Zr66.4Nb6.4Cu10.5Ni8.7Al8 alloys. The results show that the semisolid slurry which consists of the spheroidal or rosette-type BCC crystals and the liquid phase which forms metallic glass phase can be formed by the cooling slope process in this alloy system. However, the semisolid slurry cannot reach to the mold. It is considered that higher viscosity of the liquid phase which forms metallic glass phase causes this result. Thus, parameters of the cooling slope have to be examined further.",0
We have determined the superconducting transition in YBa2Cu3O7âÎ´ single crystal by measurements of thermopower. Two transitions were observed in both the ab-plane and the c-direction. The high temperature transition may have a close relation to the surface shell of the crystal.,0
"We have produced white light using infrared excitation by addictive synthesis of red, green and blue (RGB) upconverted radiation, in a lanthanide-doped fluoride-based glass, named full-color glass, FCG-III. This glass generates simultaneously RGB emissions from 980 nm excitation by up-conversion process, with high precision of color coordinates and high efficiency. The ions Er3+ and Tm3+ were used as simultaneous narrow line emitters of the three primary light colors. The Tm3+ and Er3+ concentrations in the glass host were adjusted, favoring light color tuning and generation of a wide color gamut in the visible spectrum, and white light simulation under single infrared excitation.",1
"The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time of 14N nuclear quadrupole resonance was determined to study the structural phase transition in K2Hg(CN)4. An increase of the relaxation rate which is attributable to the softening of a lattice mode was observed when the temperature approaches the transition point T c = 109 Â± 1 K from the high-temperature side. However, no anomaly in the relaxation rate was observed below T c. A small but definite hysteresis was observed in the temperature dependence of the resonance frequency indicating that this phase transition is first order.",0
"Although not fully understood, it is well recognized that optimal working of glass fibre sizings is necessary to maximize the performance of glass fibre reinforced polymer composites. It is important that the organic components in such sizings continue to function after exposure to the high temperatures often experienced during composite processing. This study presents the results on the thermal stability of polypropylene and epoxy compatible glass fibre sizings obtained using TGA, microbond adhesion measurement and composite mechanical testing. Test results indicate that the performance of commercial polypropylene compatible glass fibre sizings can be significantly compromised by thermo-oxidative degradation at normal composite processing temperatures. A significant reduction in composite performance is directly related to a loss of fibre-matrix adhesion caused by thermal degradation of some of the principal sizing components.",0
"We analyzed ac susceptibilities of a polycrystalline sample of an Ising spin glass Fe0.05TiS5 at various frequencies and fields. A rectangular distribution of the relaxation times is appropriate in both zero and non-zero fields. While the zero-field result suggests a phase transition at a finite temperature, the non-zero field one is inconsistent with it.",0
"The effect of the glass-mm, and 3 mm thicknesses were placed over glass-ionomer bases, and the microhardness of the external surface was compared with that of controls without a base. A significant reduction in surface hardness (p < 0.05) was determined only for the 1-mm test specimens.",0
"In experiments, the quasi 1-d conductors with different anisotropics can exhibit different conducting behaviors in the Peierls transition. Our theory shows that there is a critical value rc for the anisotropic ratio r=I/Iâ², where I and Iâ² are the intrachain and interchain electron hopping constants. If r>rc, the Peierls transition produces the CDW accompanied by the metal-semiconductor (m-s) transition, whereas râ¤rc, only CDW and superlattice occur at Peierls transition. This criterion tallies with the experiments.",0
"Vitreous samples containing high concentrations of WO3 (above 40%M) have been used as a target to prepare thin films. Such films were deposited using the electron beam evaporation method onto soda-lime glass substrates. These films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), perfilometry, X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), M-Lines and UVâvis absorption spectroscopy. In this work, experimental parameters were established to obtain stable thin films showing a chemical composition close to the glass precursor composition and with a high concentration of WO3. These amorphous thin films of about 4Î¼m in thickness exhibit a deep blue coloration but they can be bleached by thermal treatment near the glass transition temperature. Such bleached films show several guided modes in the visible region and have a high refractive index. Controlled crystallization was realized and thus it was possible to obtain WO3 microcrystals in the amorphous phase.",0
"This study presents strengthening effect on the reclaimed hot-mix asphalt concrete associated with the reinforcement of hybrid rod-shaped glass fibers and ball-shaped glass-fiber powder to the mix. The toughening effects of the reinforced mixtures were characterized using indirect tensile, dynamic modulus, and hamburg wheel-tracking tests. The rod-shaped hybrid fibers, coated by the polypropylene resin, consist of the macro dimension of rod-shape glass fiber in 10â15Â mm of length and the relatively micro size of the fiber in 4â6Â mm of length separately. The ball-shaped glass fiber powder, which was coated by the polyethylene resin, was mixed with the macro and micro rod-shape fibers and the reclaimed hot-mix asphalt concrete. The indirect tensile strength test of the fibrous mixtures resulted in about 1.4 times higher strength than those of the plain mixtures. Lower moisture susceptibility, better performance of dynamic modulus at low and high temperatures and superior rut resistance of the fibrous asphalt mixtures were also observed.",0
"The microstructure, and mechanical and tribological properties of zirconium-based bulk metallic glass (Zr-BMG) were investigated for golf club heads. The Zr-BMG had a fully amorphous structure without any detectable crystalline phases. The hardness and Young's modulus of the Zr-BMG were relatively high even though they were lowered by about 36% and 28% respectively by the increased indentation depth from 200 to 1000nm due to strain softening during the nanoindentation test. The tribological behaviour of the Zr-BMG was investigated by sliding against alumina (Al2O3), 100Cr6 steel or polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) balls under normal loads of 1â3N. The wear of the Zr-BMG tested against the Al2O3 and 100Cr6 balls became higher with higher normal loads while a higher wear resistance of the Al2O3 ball than that of the 100Cr6 ball caused a higher wear of the Zr-BMG. A much lower wear resistance of the PMMA ball than that of the Zr-BMG resulted in a preferential wear of the PMMA ball without generating any apparent wear of the Zr-BMG during the testing. The Zr-BMG tested against the Al2O3 ball exhibited the highest wear under all the normal loads due to the highest wear resistance of the Al2O3 ball among the counter balls.",0
"In this article the physical, thermal structural and optical properties of Dy3+ doped lithium borate glasses have been studied for white LED application. The emission spectra shows two intense emission bands at around 483Â nm and 574Â nm corresponds to the 4F9/2Â âÂ 6H15/2 and 4F9/2Â âÂ 6H13/2 transitions along with one feeble band at 663Â nm corresponds to 4F9/2Â âÂ 6H11/2 transition. The average lifetime <Ï> of Dy3+ were found to be about 2.95 and 4.94 ns for blue and yellow emission bands respectively.

"Contributions with the Ï 1.0-dependence and also the Ï q -dependence (q â 1.3) to the ac conductivity in glassy ionic conductors are ubiquitous and have properties that differ from the ionic diffusion contribution. These different properties suggest that the Ï 1.0-dependence contribution originates from the vibrational part of the ion motion which gives rise to a time-independent mean square displacement related to the Debye-Waller factor. The Ï q -dependent contribution to the ac conductivity is related to the Ï qâ1-dependent susceptibility on the low frequency side of the Boson peak which is observed experimentally by neutron scattering and Raman scattering in glasses. With the ionic diffusion contribution already being well-described by the coupling model, this work proposes that the physical origins of the various major contributions to the conductivity relaxation of glassy ionic conductors are now at hand.",0
"The Eu3+-doped red-orange emitting phosphor of tellurite glass 0.25Li2Oâ0.20Y2O3â0.5TeO2â0.05Eu2O3 has been synthesized by the melt quenching method. The amorphous nature of the glass has been verified by XRD measurements. The photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra, the luminescence decay curves have been investigated for the composition. The phosphor can be efficiently excited by the near UV light to realize the intense narrow red emission line (611Â nm) corresponding to forced electric dipole transition 5D0Â âÂ 7F2 of Eu3+ ions. The Li2OâY2O3âTeO2:Eu3+glass phosphor is a potential red-orange emitting candidate for the application in WLEDs.",1
"In this study, polydopamine (PDA) coated electrospun poly(vinyldiene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibrous membranes used as separator for lithium-ion batteries are successfully prepared. Their morphology, chemical and electrochemical characterization are investigated. The morphology and porosity measurements of the membranes show that the PDA coating does not harm to the structure of the electrospun PVDF nanofibrous membranes. Due to the PDA coating, it makes the PVDF surface hydrophilic and thus increases the electrolyte uptake and ionic conductivity, resulting in the enhanced performance of batteries. The battery using the PDA coated PVDF nanofibrous separator exhibits better cycling performance and higher power capability than that the battery using the bare PVDF nanofibrous separator. This study underlines that the PDA-coating treatment provides a promising process for the fabrication of advanced electrospun nanofibers separator in the lithium-ion battery applications.",0
"Summary Objectives. To evaluate the effects of water storage, thermocycling, and the incorporation of glass-fibers, on the flexural strength of veneering composites. Methods. Veneering composites with different fillers, matrices and polymerization methods (Belleglass Kerr Inc., Orange, CA, USA; Sculpture, Pentron Inc. Wallingford CT, USA; Sinfony, 3M Espe, Seefeld, Germany; SR Adoro LC and HP, Targis, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), a glass-fiber framework material (Vectris Pontic VP, Ivoclar Vivadent) and a direct restorative composite control (Tetric Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent) were selected. For the first part of the study, 30 bar specimens (25Ã2Ã2mm3) per material were fabricated. Ten were stored for 24h and 10 for 14 days in water at 37Â°C. Ten were thermocycled (3000Ã; 5â50â5Â°C). Three-point bending tests (crosshead speed: 0.5mm/min) were performed. For the second part of the study, all veneering materials were combined with a glass-fiber framework (VP). Sixty specimens were produced for each material (25Ã4Ã2mm3) and treated as in the first part. Three-point bend tests were performed with the reinforcing glass-fiber framework either on the tension or the compression side. Data was evaluated by ANOVA and Weibull analysis. Results. A decrease in flexural strength was observed after water storage or thermocycling for all veneering materials tested. None of the tested materials exhibited significant advantages compared to the control. The flexural strength of glass-fiber reinforced frameworks was ten times higher and not influenced by water storage or thermocycling. A significant reinforcing effect from glass fibers was observed when they were placed on the tension but not when placed on the compression side. Significance. A glass-fiber framework on the tension side significantly improved the flexural strength of veneering composites. There was less deterioration due to water storage and thermocycling with the glass-fiber reinforced veneering composite compared to the non-reinforced materials.",0
The results of a detailed molecular dynamics investigation of relaxation in the van der Waals system o-terphenyl are presented.

"Herein, glass-free microwave dielectric ceramics CaMg0.9-xLi0.2ZnxSi2O6 (xÂ =Â 0â0.36) with excellent microwave dielectric properties were prepared via traditional solid-state reaction method. Phase composition and crystalline structure were identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD), which confirmed that the ceramics contained more than one phase. Rietveld refinement method was utilized to analyze XRD data and obtain structural information, such as lattice parameters. SEM photographs showed that Zn2+ substitution could effectively promote densification of the ceramics. Microwave dielectric properties were obviously influenced by the combination of multiple phases. Combined with Raman spectra, influences of Raman shift and FWHM of vibration peaks on microwave dielectric properties were determined. The CaMg0.9-xLi0.2ZnxSi2O6 ceramic exhibited high performance at xÂ =Â 0.28 with: QÂ ÃÂ fÂ =Â 68,190Â GHz, ÎµrÂ =Â 7.51 and ÏfÂ =Â â68Â ppm/Â°C, when sintered at 900Â Â°C.

"The strain rate sensitivity (SRS) of CuZr-based bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) containing a B2-CuZr phase with different volume fractions was investigated by performing uniaxial compression tests in a strain-rate-jump mode. It is found that the SRS exponents of the BMGCs can vary from negative to positive in the strain-rate range from 3.7Ã10â5 sâ1 to 3.7Ã10â3 sâ1 with increasing of the B2-CuZr phase volume fraction. However, the positive SRS exponent of the BMGC with a higher B2-CuZr phase volume fraction up to about 80% is still unexpectedly low. This is attributed to the limited strain-rate-dependence of mechanical behavior of the B2-CuZr phase, which is induced by the martensitic transformation effect of the phase during deformation. It is obvious that the SRS ceiling of the CuZr-based BMGCs is controlled by the B2-CuZr phase.",0
"CuIr2S4 exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition around 230 K. The metal-insulator transition of CuIr2S4 is ascribed to the structural phase transition from the cubic high-temperature metallic phase to the tetragonal low-temperature insulating phase. There is no localized magnetic moment in both of metallic and insulating phases. On the other hand, CuIr2Se4 stays metallic down to 0.5 K without any anomaly. The magnetic susceptibility of CuIr2Se4 shows a weak positive temperature dependence of dÏ/dT>0 with rather large diamagnetism of core electrons, which might indicate a characteristic of strongly-correlated electrons.",0
"The temperature dependence of the Lamb-MÃ¶ssbauer factor, f(T), in a solid provides the first inverse, ã 1 Ï ã, and second inverse, ã 1 Ï2 ã, moments of the vibrational density of states. In network glasses, these moments serve as local probes of low-frequency vibrational excitations, such as floppy modes, and provide a means to establish the rigidity percolation threshold. Lamb-MÃ¶ssbauer results on prototypical chalcogenide glasses (Ge x Se1âx ) correlate well with those of Raman scattering, inelastic neutron scattering and MÃ¶ssbauer hyperfine structure experiments in indicating that the rigidity percolation threshold occurs near ãrãc = 2.46(4). These observations provide experimental support for predictions of the Phillips-Thorpe constraint theory, when provision is made for a small but finite concentration of broken bond-bending constraints around chalcogen sites.",0

"Zinc Lead Alumino Borate (ZPAB) glasses doped with varying concentrations of Terbium (Tb3+) ions have been prepared via melt quenching technique. Structural studies like XRD and FT-IR were performed to ascertain the amorphous nature and functional groups present in the as prepared glasses respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of the as prepared glasses were investigated by performing excitation and emission spectral studies under 545â¯nm and 369â¯nm wavelengths respectively. Under n-UV excitation, these glasses exhibit four emission peaks due to transitions from the excited 5D4 level of Tb3+ to 7FJ (Jâ¯=â¯3 to 6) ground level. Among all, the intense emission band was observed at 545â¯nm corresponding to the 5D4â7F5 transition and the emission intensity increases up to 1â¯mol%, beyond concentration quenching took place. The Dexter theory confirms the possibility of energy transfer via electric dipole-dipole interaction between Tb3+-Tb3+ ions. The CIE chromaticity coordinates and color purity were evaluated which falls in intense green region and close to European Broadcasting Union illuminant green. The PL decay studies were carried out to know the experimental lifetimes of the fluorescent levels of Tb3+ ions. The lifetime measured for 5D4â7F5 transition of the as prepared glasses decreasing with increase in Tb3+ ions concentration, may be due to efficient energy transfer between Tb3+-Tb3+ ions. The aforementioned results confirm potentiality of these glasses in solid state green laser and as a green component in tricolor w-LEDs.",1
"We study a spin system with both two- and four-spin exchange interactions on the triangular lattice, which is a possible model for the nuclear magnetism of solid3He layers. We find that a novel phase with scalar chiral order appears if the four-spin interaction is dominant. Ground-state properties are studied using the spin-wave approximation. A phase transition concerning the scalar chirality occurs at a finite temperature, since the chirality is an Ising-type variable. Critical phenomena of this transition are studied by Monte Carlo simulations in the classical limit.",0
"In this work, quaternary Fe72âx M x Y6B22 (M=Ni, Co and Mo) bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have been developed. It is found that a fully amorphous Fe68Mo4Y6B22 cylindrical rod with 6.5mm in diameter can be prepared by copper mold injection. These alloys have a high glass transition temperature of about 900K with high fracture strengths up to about 3GPa although they are still brittle. Magnetic measurements reveal that they are ferromagnetic at ambient temperature with low coercive force of about 2A/m, saturation magnetization of about 0.7T and effective permeability of about 7000 at 100kHz. The newly developed Fe-based quaternary alloys exhibit excellent combination properties: superior glass forming ability (GFA), high glass transition temperature, and soft magnetic properties, which could have potential applications in electronic industries. Furthermore, the effect of Mo addition on GFA in the FeâYâB BMG system has been discussed compared with those of Ni and Co additions.",0
"Transparent conducting antimony-doped tin oxide (SnO2:Sb) films have been prepared on polyimide and Corning 7059 substrates by radio frequency magnetron-sputtering technique at low substrate temperature (30â220Â°C). Polycrystalline SnO2:Sb films having the rutile structure were deposited with resistivity as low as 3.7Ã10â3 Î©cm on polyimide substrate and 2Ã10â3 Î©cm on glass substrate. The average transmittance exceeded 70.6 and 85.5% in the visible spectrum for 285 and 315nm thick films deposited on polyimide and glass substrate, respectively. A comparison of the properties for the films deposited on glass and organic substrates was performed.",0
"In this study, the influence of the glass addition and sintering parameters on the densification and mechanical properties of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (3Y-TZP) ceramics were evaluated. High-purity tetragonal ZrO2 powder and La2O3-rich glass were used as starting powders. Two compositions based on ZrO2 and containing 5wt.% and 10wt.% of La2O3-rich glass were studied in this work. The starting powders were mixed/milled by planetary milling, dried at 90Â°C for 24h, sieved through a 60mesh screen and uniaxially cold pressed under 80MPa. The samples were sintered in air at 1200Â°C, 1300Â°C, 1400Â°C for 60min and at 1450Â°C for 120min, with heating and cooling rates of 10Â°C/min. Sintered samples were characterized by relative density, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Hardness and fracture toughness were obtained by Vickers indentation method. Dense sintered samples were obtained for all conditions. Furthermore, only tetragonal-ZrO2 was identified as crystalline phase in sintered samples, independently of the conditions studied. Samples sintered at 1300Â°C for 60min presented the optimal mechanical properties with hardness and fracture toughness values near to 12GPa and 8.5MPam1/2, respectively.",0
"The physical properties and setting characteristics of a glass polyalkenoate cement reinforced with sintered metallic particles, have been compared with those of a conventional material from the same manufacturer. The compressive strength, the compressive fatigue limit and the abrasion resistance rating are improved with the addition of silver particles in the glass. At the same time, the new material undergoes a more rapid setting reaction than the conventional cement and is significantly less susceptible to erosion in pH 4.0 buffer. The silver âreinforcedâ material was similarly susceptible to 2-body abrasion with an element of fatigue, but was more susceptible to 3-body abrasion and exhibited a lower modulus of elasticity and flexural strength when compared to the conventional material. The proposed uses for this new material are discussed with regard to these findings.",0
"In this paper, filament wound glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP) tubes were studied. Impact tests were realized at 5J and 10J energy levels. Forceâtime and forceâdisplacement curves were obtained and damage zones were also examined. The burst strengths of tubes were found in accordance with ASTM-D 1599 before and after impact. For fatigue tests, PLC controlled hydraulic inner-pressure fatigue test rig was set up. Damaged and non-damaged tubes were subjected to the fatigue test in accordance with ASTM-D 2992. The samples were exposed to five different stress levels; 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 60% of the burst strength. Number of cycles occurred up to the final failure was recorded and SâN diagrams were plotted. The burst strength and the fatigue life of the damaged GRP pipes were decreased as the impact energy increased. Also the decrease in the fatigue life was greater than that of the burst strength.",0
"The effects of the electropulsing on microstructural evolution and on the elongation of the ZA22 alloy were studied during tensile deformation. The microsturctural evolution was examined by using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Uniaxial tensile test showed that with adequate electropulsing, the best elongation of the alloy was obtained at ambient temperature (28Â°C) and a high deformation rate (2mm/min), remained the instant tensile stress unchanged. The elongation increased by 437%, compared with that of the non-electropulsing treated alloy. The relationship between the elongation and the electropulsing is discussed from the point of view of dislocation dynamic and phase transformation.",0
"The impact behavior of glass, aramid and glassâaramid hybrid fabric epoxy matrix composites was evaluated. Delamination was identified as the main macroscopic failure mode of the composites. A simple relationship based on the macromechanical behavior of laminated composites was established, relating couplingâA 26, D 26âand shearâA 16, D 16âelements of the extensional and bending stiffness matrices to the total energy absorbed at impact. The results obtained show that the A 66/D 66 ratio is a relevant parameter of concern, correlated with the behavior of the composites under impact. Additionally, the coupling matrix B ij was shown to restrain the macroscopic delamination of the composites.",0
"Non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of cuspidine (Ca4Si2O7F2) in CaOâSiO2âCaF2 based glass system has been investigated using a DSC to understand and improve the performances of mold fluxes applied to commercial continuous casting of steels. It was found that the Ozawa analysis is not suitable to depict non-isothermal melt crystallization of glasses. Instead, the effective activation energy for non-isothermal crystallization was estimated using differential iso-conversional method of Friedman analysis. The effective activation energy of cuspidine formation for the glasses examined showed negative sign, from â241 to â652kJ/mol. It remains constant over the range from 0.1 to 0.4 of the degree of crystallinity, whereas it increases as the degree of crystallinity exceeds 0.4. The negative effective activation energy indicates an anti-Arrhenius behavior for crystallization of the glasses investigated, which means that the melt crystallization for the commercial mold fluxes will be determined by thermodynamics of nucleation which is relevant to degree of undercooling. The crystalline morphology of cuspidine observed by SEM and a SHTT also supported the anti-Arrhenius kinetics during non-isothermal melt crystallization.",1
"To improve the 1.53Î¼m band emission of Er3+, the trivalent Yb3+ ions were introduced into the Er3+ single-doped tellurite glass with composition of TeO2âZnOâLa2O3, a potential gain medium for Er3+-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). The improved effects were investigated from the measured 1.53Î¼m band and visible band spontaneous emission spectra together with the calculated 1.53Î¼m band stimulated emission (signal gain) spectra under the excitation of 975nm laser diode (LD). It was found that Yb3+/Er3+ co-doping scheme can remarkably improve the visible band up-conversion and the 1.53Î¼m band fluorescence emission intensity, and meanwhile improves the 1.53Î¼m band signal gain to some extent, which were attributed to the result of the effective energy transfer of Yb3+:2F5/2 +Er3+:4I15/2 âYb3+:2F7/2 +Er3+:4I11/2. The quantitative study of energy transfer mechanism was performed and microscopic energy transfer parameters between the doped rare-earth ions were determined. In addition, the spectroscopic properties of Er3+ were also investigated from the measured absorption spectrum according to the JuddâOfelt theory, and the structure behavior and thermal stability of the prepared tellurite glass were analyzed based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measurements, respectively.",1
"Compressive deformation behavior of the Ti40Zr25Ni8Cu9Be18 bulk metallic glass was investigated over a wide strain rate ranging from 10â4 to 103 sâ1 at room temperature. Fracture stress was found to increase and fracture strain decrease with increasing applied strain rate, which were due to the decrease of the density of shear bands. Serrated flow was observed at lower strain rate. The appearance of a large number of shear bands was probably associated with flow serration observed during compression. At high strain rates, the rate of shear band nucleation was not sufficient to accommodate the applied strain rate and thus caused an early fracture of the test sample. The positive strain rate dependence of compressive strength might be associated with the different microstructure on the atomic scale in the Ti-based amorphous matrix.",0
"Glass powder (GP) is considered as a pozzolanic material, thus it can be used as a partial cement replacement material. Its effect on the microstructure and on the mechanical properties is controlled by its chemical composition, particle size distribution (PSD), the amount of replacement and the curing conditions. The effect of cement replacement by glass powder on the rheological and the mechanical properties of cement paste is studied. Two types of cements were used (CEMI and CEMII) at five different percentages of glass powder replacement (0, 10, 20, 25 and 30%). The results showed an increase in the cement paste flow using CEMI compared to CEMII. Also, the initial and final setting times were lower at CEMI than CEMII. Increasing the replacement percentages by higher glass powder resulted in a decrease in the linear and volume expansion of the mixes due to the reduction of the ASR. The 10 and 20% GP mixes showed a higher compressive strength at longer ages than the control mix which is related to the pozzolanic reactivity of the glass powder. Bottom Ash was added to the 20% GP mix, at different percentages (2.5, 5, 10 and 20%). The maximum compressive strength was obtained at 5% BA mix.",0
"Ga-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Ga) films were grown on glass substrate by atmospheric pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (AP-MOCVD) using diethylzinc and water as reactant gases and triethyl gallium (TEG) as an n-type dopant gas. The structural, electrical and optical properties of ZnO:Ga films obtained at various flow rates of TEG ranging from 1.5 to 10Â sccm were investigated. X-ray diffraction patterns and scanning electron microscopy images indicated that Ga-doping plays an important role in forming microstructures in ZnO films. A smooth surface with a predominant orientation of (101) was obtained for the ZnO:Ga film grown at a flow rate of TEG=7.5Â sccm. Moreover, a lowest resistivity of 3.6Ã10â4Â Î© cm and a highest mobility of 30.4Â cm2 Vâ1 sâ1 were presented by the same sample, as evaluated by Hall measurement. Otherwise, as the flow rate of TEG was increased, the average transmittance of ZnO:Ga films increased from 75% to more than 85% in the wavelength range of 400â800Â nm, simultaneously with a blue-shift in the absorption edge. The results obtained suggest that low-resistivity and high-transparency ZnO films can be obtained by AP-MOCVD using Ga-doping sufficiently to make the films grow degenerate and effect the BursteinâMoss shift to raise the band-gap energy from 3.26 to 3.71Â eV.",0
"In order to study elastic stress effects on the surface deformability of BMGs, indentations with a Berkovich diamond pyramid were done on an artificially bent Zr-based metallic glass stripe (Vitreloy-1). Residual indentation marks formed with a peak load of 500Â mN were observed with an atomic force microscope for 7 artificial stress steps. Significant pile-ups (or surface upheavals around indents) and shear bands were observed at low stress levels less than 244Â MPa and disappeared with an increase of the tensile stress. From a 3D morphological viewpoint, the tensile stress in elastic regime is understood to be beneficial to the surface formability of the Zr-based BMG, because the tensile stress invokes deeper indentations with slight elastic recovery and reduces the irregular pile-ups with shear bands.",0
"Electronic band structure, optical and vibrational properties of zinc-blende GaP x Sb1â x and GaAs1â x P x ternary alloys are obtained from pseudo-potential calculations. Comparisons are made with the available experimental values and with data obtained in previous theoretical studies. These comparisons show generally good agreement between the present results and experiment. The direct and indirect band-gap energies, the transverse effective charge, and the longitudinal and transversal optical phonon energies show a non-linear behavior with varying the composition x. The ionicity of the materials of interest is discussed in terms of the antisymmetric gap.",0
"The electronic structure and phase stability of the Zr66.7Ni33.3 and Zr66.7Cu33.3 metallic glasses has been investigated by the recursion calculations method using a giant atom-cluster, of which arrangements of constituent atoms were determined by the Reverse Monte Carlo experimental structural studies reported before [T. Fukunaga, K. Itoh, T. Otomo, K. Mori, M. Sugiyama, H. Kato, M. Hasegawa, A. Hirata, Y. Hirotsu, Intermetallics 14 (2006) 893]. The electronic structure of the former is similar to that of the relevant Zr2Ni compound, while that of the latter is completely different from that of the relevant Zr2Cu compound. We have also calculated the band energy of the characteristic clusters in these metallic glasses. The smaller and Zr-richer these clusters are, the lower the band energy at the center of the cluster tends to be. The stability of these characteristic clusters of both metallic glasses can be explained by the total band energy based on the calculated local density of states and is consistent with the reported experimental Volonoi analysis.",0
"The role of CaF2 on the structure, crystallization behaviour and properties of a relatively simple non-stoichiometric lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) based glass composition was studied. Different x amounts (x =0, 1, 3 and 5mol%) of CaF2 were added to (100â x) of a parent glass (22.96Li2Oâ2.63K2Oâ2.63Al2O3â71.78SiO2) composition. The glasses were produced by conventional melt-quenching technique, whilst glassâceramics were produced via crystallization of monolithic bulk glasses. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of as cast non-annealed monolithic glasses revealed precipitation of nanosize droplet phase in glassy matrices suggesting the occurrence of liquid phase separation in all investigated compositions. The extent of phase segregation, as judged from the mean droplet diameter and the packing density of droplets, decreased with increasing CaF2 content in the glasses. A slight depolymerisation of the glass network was observed according to magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies, suggesting a network modifier role for CaF2. The presence of CaF2 enhanced the crystallization at lower temperatures in comparison to CaF2-free glass.",1
"Compression testing shows that at low-oxygen levels (240ppm) the Cu49Hf42Al9 glass deforms predominantly by shear and is quite tough. Specimens with higher oxygen levels (1700ppm) have oxygen-containing dendrites in an amorphous matrix and show no plasticity. Importantly, the dominant fracture mode is not shear but local tensile failure. Although there is a slight reduction in the toughness of the glassy matrix, the severe embrittlement is primarily because of the brittle dendrites that facilitate crack initiation and propagation.",0
"A series of Ce3+/Sm3+ doped glasses were prepared in this study and their luminescence properties were analyzed. A combination of blue and orange-red emission band was observed from these glasses, and tunable white light emission could be observed by adjusting concentration ratio of Ce3+ to Sm3+ under UV light excitation. Energy transfer (ET) from Ce3+ to Sm3+ is discovered by directly observing significant overlap of the excitation spectrum of Sm3+ and the emission spectrum of Ce3+ ions. The energy transfer from Ce3+ to Sm3+ via a dipoleâdipole mechanism was confirmed by the luminescence spectra, the decay lifetime and the calculation of energy transfer efficiency of the glasses. Based on the results in this study, the Ce3+/Sm3+ doped glasses could be used as a potential matrix material for ultraviolet light emitting diode (LED) chip based white LEDs.",1
"The correlation between the refraction basicity (B ref) and theoretical optical basicity (Î th) was investigated in the glasses of the PbOî¸SiO2, CaOî¸Al2O3î¸SiO3 and K2Oî¸TiO2î¸SiO2 systems. It is concluded that the basicity of silicate glass containing highly covalent cation-oxygen bonds such as the Pbî¸O bond cannot be predicted by Î th because the effect of symmetry restricted covalency on electron donation cannot be estimated by fixing Ï M as constant. On the contrary, B ref can detect the difference of polarization of oxygen in silicate glasses without relating to the covalency of the cation-oxygen bond, so that B ref can be utilized as a measure of the basicity of silicate glass.",1
"Present work reports the colour tunable characteristics of Dy3+- doped zinc sodium bismuth borate glasses with Eu3+ and Pr3+ co-dopants synthesized through melt quench technique. The absence of sharp peaks in the XRD confirmed the amorphous nature of co-doped glasses. Absorption peaks of Dy3+, Eu3+ and Pr3+ions are found in visible and NIR region of the spectrum. The optical band gap of the glasses were determined through absorption spectra. The excitation spectra exhibited various transitions of Dy3+, Eu3+ and Pr3+ ions in the UV and blue region of the spectrum. The emission spectra of Eu3+ and Pr3+co-doped glass showed blue, yellow and red emissions. Decay curves were measured to confirm the energy transfer processes between Dy3+âEu3+ and Pr3+ ions. The Inokuti-Hirayama model was used to understand the nature of interaction between Dy3+âEu3+ and Pr3+ ions during non-radiative energy transfer in the co-doped glasses. CIE chromaticity coordinates shifted from yellowish to orange-reddish region. The correlated colour temperature value of optimum glass was around 3800â¯K which further illustrates the application of co-doped glasses in indoor lighting under UV/blue light excitation.",1
"This study exploits the potential of thin-ply carbon/glass hybrid laminates to generate high performance Quasi-Isotropic (QI) composite plates that show pseudo-ductility in all fibre orientations under tensile loading, overcoming the inherent brittleness of conventional composites. Two types of QI lay-ups with 45Â° and 60Â° intervals, i.e. [45/90/-45/0] and [60/-60/0], were used to fabricate novel architectures of a QI T300-carbon laminate sandwiched between the two halves of a QI S-glass laminate. The fabricated plates were then loaded in all their fibre orientations. The laminates were designed by choosing an appropriate ratio of the carbon thickness to the laminate thickness using a robust analytical damage mode map. The experimental results verified the analytical predictions and showed a desirable pseudo-ductile failure in all the fibre orientations. Microscope images taken through the laminates thickness showed fragmentations (fibre fractures in the carbon layer) appearing only in the 0Â° carbon plies. A hybrid effect was observed, with an increase in strain and stress to failure of the carbon fibres, which was found to be dependent on the stiffness of the plies separating the 0Â° carbon plies and the plies adjacent to the 0Â° carbon plies. Altering the stacking sequence changes the stiffness of the separator and adjacent plies, therefore, leads to changes in the pseudo-ductile characteristics such as the initiation and final failure strains.",0
"In order to realize new high performance electrodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the careful design of nanoarchitectures and effective hybridization of active materials are research areas of great interest. Here, we present a simple and highly controllable two-step fabrication technique, followed by a heat treatment process, for the large-scale in situ growth of 3D hierarchical tubular CuO/other metal oxides core/shell heterostructure arrays that are directly grown on Cu foam. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the application of such 3D hierarchical tubular heterostructure arrays, the prepared tubular CuO/CoO core/shell arrays are investigated as binder- and conductive agent-free anodes for LIBs, exhibiting an impressive capacity of 1364mAhgâ1 at a current density of 100mAgâ1 after 50 cycles and maintaining 1140mAhgâ1 after 1000 cycles at 1.0Agâ1. This excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique hollow porous architecture consisting of 3D hierarchical tubular core/shell architectures, and the effective hybridization of two electrochemically cohesive active materials. Our work shows that this material has great potential for high-energy and high-power energy storage applications.",0
"Absorption and luminescence measurements have been performed on aluminum fluorophosphate glasses in the system AlF3âMgF2âCaF2âSrF2âBaF2âYF3âZrF4âNaPO3, doped with 0.1 and 1 mol% Er3+. A green-to-blue upconversion fluorescence has been observed upon continuous-wave excitation at 514.5 nm. The upconversion intensity has a quadratic dependence on the incident pump power, indicating that two photons are responsible for the frequency upconversion process. The main mechanisms that produce the upconversion are excited state absorption and energy transfer among erbium ions. Emission in the third telecom window (1.5 Î¼ m) has been measured upon excitation at 514.5 nm.",1
"The primary nanocrystallization behavior and microstructural evolution of the Zr61Al7.5Cu17.5Ni10Si4 alloy during annealing were investigated by isothermal differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy. During continuous heating of the 4Si and the base (contains no Si) amorphous alloys at a heating rate of 10K/min, the saturation point of nucleation for the 4Si amorphous alloy occurs at a crystallization fraction of 78%, which is significantly higher than 65% for the base alloy, implying that these metalloid atoms would extend the nucleation stage and refine crystalline particles. The sequence of crystallization phase from the amorphous matrix for the isothermally annealed 4Si amorphous alloy at 703K is observed to be Zr2Cu and Zr2Ni at the early stage, Zr3Al at an intermediate stage, and Zr2Si at the final stage. Moreover, enrichment of Si atoms at the interface between Zr2Cu crystal and the amorphous matrix is detected. This may result in increasing the thermal stability of the remaining amorphous phase and retardation of the crystal growth of Zr2Cu particles.",0
Rapidly quenched lithium tungstate and molybdate glasses containing up to 20 mole% lithium chloride and bromide additives have been prepared. The additives are found to give a small increase (up to a factor of two at room temperature) in the lithium ion conductivity of the glass which can be understood in terms of models developed for network forming glasses.,1
"Host (H), Singly and co-doped Dy3+/Tb3+ ions borosilicate glasses (S1-S7) were fabricated by a traditional melt-quenching-annealing method to investigate their luminescence properties as well as their suitability for the development of SSL (solid-state lighting) and W-LEDs (white light-emitting diodes). The X-ray diffraction profile indicates the amorphous structure nature of the prepared glasses. The J-O (Judd-Ofelt) intensity parameters Î© t ( t = 2 , 4 , 6 ) are evaluated for both singly Dy3+, Tb3+ doped glasses according to their absorption spectrum. The Î©2 parameter of Dy3+ ion has higher value which indicates a higher degree of Dy3+ covalency and the neighbour ligands while Tb3+ ion in a lower degree of covalency where its Î©2 has low value. Also the radiative parameters for both singly doped ions (S1 and S2) are computed like probability of transition (AT ), branching ratio (Î²r ) and radiative lifetime (Ïr ) for different bands. Further, both singly doped glasses reflects good properties for lasing application where the 4F9/2 manifold of S1 (0.5 mol% Dy3+) has radiative lifetime (Ïr ) value of 1376 Âµs and higher value of (A T:447.02 s â 1 ) in addition to branching ration of (Î²r :61.5%) for the (4F9/2â9H13/2) transition (576Â nm). At the same time, S2 (0.5 mol% Tb3+) glass show a higher lifetime (Ïr :3753) for 5D4 level and (A T: â92.94 s â 1 ) while the branching ratio for 5D4â7F5 band at 546Â nm wavelength is (Î²r : â34.9%). The radiative emission properties were investigated according to the Tb3+ concentration increments. The mutual energy transfer (ET) occurrence between both ions (Dy3+, Tb3+) is demonstrated through the varying of their emission intensities. Furthermore, The chromaticity (x,y) color coordinates were evaluated according to the emission spectra of aforementioned glasses under excitation of 368Â nm and 348Â nm were found to be located in the white light color region of the CIE chromaticity color diagram. Also, from color-coordinated the color correlated temperature (CCT) is computed were found to be at high values (>4000). Thus, the fabricated glasses are suggested as a useful luminescence material for solid-state lightening as well as cool white light applications.",1
"A spectroscopic investigation of Tb3+/Sm3+ codoped SiO2âAl2O3âCaOâCaF2 glasses and glass ceramics is presented. Full color photoluminescence combining blue, green and orange-red light was realized by ultraviolet light excitation. The emission spectra showed that the intensity was enhanced with the increasing concentration of Fâ anions. Meanwhile, the self-quenching effect of Sm3+ ions and an energy transfer from Tb3+ to Sm3+ ions were evidenced. Significantly increased luminescent intensity was observed from glasses to glass ceramics, which was attributed to the precipitation of rare-earth ions into the lower phonon energy CaF2 crystallites.",1
"The mechanical performance of injection moulded long glass fibre reinforced polypropylene with a glass fibre content in the range 0â73% by weight has been investigated. The composite modulus exhibited a linear dependence on fibre content over the full range of the study. Composite strength and impact resistance exhibited a maximum in performance in the 40â50% by weight reinforcement content range. The residual fibre length, average fibre orientation, interfacial shear strength, and fibre strain at composite failure in the samples have been characterised. These parameters were also found to be fibre concentration dependent. The interfacial shear strength was found to be influenced by both physical and chemical contributions. Theoretical calculations of the composite strength using the measured micromechanical parameters enabled the observed maximum in tensile strength to be well modelled.",0
"Silicon carbide has a good match of chemical, mechanical and thermal properties and therefore is considered an excellent structural ceramic for high temperature applications. The aim of the present work is compressive creep evaluation of liquid phase sintered silicon carbide with aluminum and rare earth oxide as sintering aids. Rare earth oxides are possible additives considering their highly refractory remnant grain-boundary phase and lower synthesis costs compared to high purity rare earth. Samples were prepared with silicon carbide powder (90wt%) and aluminum oxide (5wt%) plus rare earth oxide (5wt%) additions. Powders were mixed, milled and hot pressed at 1800Â°C in argon atmosphere. Compressive creep tests were carried out under stress from 150 to 300MPa and temperatures from 1300 to 1400Â°C. At lower creep test temperatures, the obtained stress exponent values were correlated to mechanisms based on diffusion. At intermediate temperatures, grain-boundary sliding becomes operative, accommodated by diffusion. At higher temperatures cavities are discernible. Oxidation reactions and ionic diffusion result on surface oxidized layer, grain-boundary amorphous and intergranular crystalline Al6Si2O13, Î´-Y2Si2O7 and YAG phases. In this case cavitation and amorphous phases redistribution enhance grain-boundary sliding, not accommodated by diffusion. Coalescence occurs at triple point and multigrain-junctions, with subsequent strain rate acceleration and cavitational creep.",1
"The ferric pseudobrookite is a rare example of uniaxial anisotropic spin-glass insulator, depicting a multiglass behavior and magnetoelectric coupling. Here, we present Raman spectroscopy results in order to elucidate the spin-phonon coupling in Fe2TiO5 for the first time. The experimental data are supported by computational simulations performed in view of density functional theory, which allowed us to assign the main Raman-active modes. Temperature-dependent phonon behavior exhibited anomalous evolution around 55 and 80â200â¯K, which was explained as successive coupling between lattice and spin configuration arising from spin freezing and short-range magnetic correlation, respectively. Arguments that the magnetoelectric effect in Fe2TiO5 is mediated by spin-phonon coupling are presented.",0
"RÃ©sumÃ© La maladie de Dercum ou adipose douloureuse est une pathologie rare et mÃ©connue. La prÃ©sentation clinique est caractÃ©ristique avec quatre symptÃ´mes cardinaux. Elle se manifeste par des douleurs au niveau de tumeurs adipeuses, en gÃ©nÃ©ral chez la femme mÃ©nopausÃ©e. Le but de cet article est de prÃ©senter la maladie Ã partir d'un cas clinique peu frÃ©quentÂ : un choc septique secondaire Ã une stÃ©atocutanÃ©onÃ©crose d'une tumeur adipeuse. La maladie reste rare. L'Ã©tiologie est Ã ce jour inconnue, et diffÃ©rentes hypothÃ¨ses (endocriniennes, mÃ©tabolique, gÃ©nÃ©tique) sont avancÃ©es. De multiples complications peuvent survenir mais les septicÃ©mies graves sont peu rencontrÃ©es. Le traitement est soit mÃ©dical (perte de poids, corticoÃ¯des, lidocaÃ¯ne intraveineuse) soit chirurgical (exÃ©rÃ¨seâsuture, lipoaspiration). Dercum's disease or adiposis dolorasa is unusual and unknown. Four symptoms are typical. It is characterized by painful subcutaneous fatty tumors in postmenopausal woman. We present this disease through the study of an uncommon clinical case: a sceptic choc following the âsteato-cutaneous-necrosisâ of a fatty tumor. The disease remains rare. The etiology is to this day unknown and different hypothesis (endocrinous, metabolic, genetics) are put forward. Multiple complications can occur but severe septicemia is rare. The treatment can be medical (loss of weight, corticoids, intravenous lidocaine) or surgical (surgical excision or liposuction).",0
"Phosphate glasses based on xNa2O0.5P2O5 (0.5âx)GeO2 (0.0â©½ x â©½0.5)mol%, were prepared and their structures were characterized by magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman and IR spectroscopy techniques. It was found that the phosphate network of these glasses is composed of middle (Q2) and branching (Q3) phosphate tetrahedra, whereas germanium part in the network is composed of three- or four-membered GeO4 tetrahedral rings. It was also found that the germanium tetrahedral are randomly connected to either Q2 or Q3 phosphate units in the network. The glass network, especially the Q2 units can be modified by the presence of Na ions. This modification is primarily associated with the phosphate. It is found that these glasses behave as if they are formed from a solution of GeO2 and sodiumâphosphate glass with various GeO4 units and the Q2 and Q3 phosphate units randomly distributed in the network.",1
Mechanical and thermal properties of non-crimp glass fiber reinforced clay/epoxy nanocomposites were investigated. Clay/epoxy nanocomposite systems were prepared to use as the matrix material for composite laminates. X-ray diffraction results obtained from natural and modified clays indicated that intergallery spacing of the layered clay increases with surface treatment. Tensile tests indicated that clay loading has minor effect on the tensile properties. Flexural properties of laminates were improved by clay addition due to the improved interface between glass fibers and epoxy. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed that the modified clay particles affected the glass transition temperatures (T g) of the nanocomposites. Incorporation of surface treated clay particles increased the dynamic mechanical properties of nanocomposite laminates. It was found that the flame resistance of composites was improved significantly by clay addition into the epoxy matrix.,0
"Near the liquid-glass transition, the sound picture holds in the short wavelength regime and disappears at the sound disappearing temperature and a reciprocal particle distance. Under the super-cooling process, enormous bubbles of intra-band particle-hole pairs form the sound fluctuation entropy. The mixing entropy between the sound fluctuations and sound yields the Kauzmann entropy of the form of the Curie law. The hopping amplitude, given by the probability of the Kauzmann entropy, yields the VTF law on the relaxation times and the transport coefficients. The intermediate scattering function and a generalized Navier-Stokes equation are also discussed.

"The heat capacity changes during the glass transition of TeO2î¸TlO0.5 glasses containing AgI or (AgI)0.75(TlI)0.25 up to mole fractions of 0.4 or 0.55 have been measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The glass transition temperatures of the binary compositions decrease with increasing TlO 0.5 TeO 2 ratio. With rising Ag+ concentration, the cohesion of the glass network is weakened and the structural contributions to the relaxation phenomenon as well as its activation enthalpies diminish. There is no interaction between the iodide in probably crystalline form and the host glass network. Compared with binary and ternary silver tellurite glasses, the corresponding thallium tellurite compositions are less stable.",1
"A promising energy transfer (Tm3+ âTb3+ âEu3+) approach is brought forward to generate white light emission under ultraviolet (UV) light excitation for solid state lightening. Tm3+/Tb3+/Eu3+ ions are combinedly doped in zinc borate glass system in view of understanding energy transfer process resulting in white light emission. Zinc borate (host) glass displayed optical and luminescence properties due to formation of Zn(II)xâ[O(âII)]y centres in the ZnB glass matrix. At 360nm (UV) excitation, triply doped Tm3+/Tb3+/Eu3+: ZnB glasses simultaneously shown their characteristic emission bands in blue (454nm: 1D2 â 3F4), green (547nm: 5D4 â 7F5) and red (616nm: 5D0 â 7F2) regions. In triple ions doped glasses, energy transfer dynamics is discussed in terms of Forster-Dexter theory, excitation & emission profiles, lifetime curves and from partial energy level diagram of three ions. The role of Tb3+ in ET from Tm3+ âEu3+ was discussed using branch model. From emission decay analysis, energy transfer probability (P) and efficiency (Î·) were evaluated. Colour tunability from blue to white on varying (Tb3+, Eu3+) content is demonstrated from Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates. Based on chromaticity coordinates, other colour related parameters like correlated colour temperature (CCT) and colour purity are also computed for the studied glass samples. An appropriate blending of such combination of rare earth ions could show better suitability as potential candidates in achieving multi-colour and warm/cold white light emission for white LEDs application in the field of solid state lightening.",1
"The up-converted fluorescence of Pr3+ in tellurite glasses was observed at 487 nm (3P0 â3H4), following excitation with a 593 nm tuned to the1D2 level. Both the up-converted and Stokes fluorescence show the same temporal behavior with the lifetime of 4 Î¼s. It is suggested that the sequential two-photon excitation process (STEP) is the dominant mechanism of the up-conversion in this system.",1
"The low velocity impact behavior of E-glass/basalt reinforced hybrid laminates, manufactured by resin transfer moulding technique, was investigated. Specimens prepared with different stacking sequences were tested at three different impact energies, namely 5J, 12.5J and 25J. Residual post-impact mechanical properties of the different configurations were characterized by quasi static four point bending tests. Post-impact flexural tests have been also monitored using acoustic emission in order to get further information on failure mechanisms. Results showed that basalt and hybrid laminates with an intercalated configuration exhibited higher impact energy absorption capacity than glass laminates, and enhanced damage tolerance capability. Conversely, the most favorable flexural behavior was shown by laminates with symmetrical sandwich-like configuration (E-glass fiber fabrics as core and basalt fiber fabrics as skins).",0
"In order to investigate the spin dynamics on CuO2 plane depending on carrier density, MÃ¶ssbauer effect was measured for the samples of (La1âx Sr x )2Cu1ây Fe y O4. Doublet spectra appear at room temperature but split into sextet below the temperature T f, which coexists with superconducting transition in the case of y=0.01. The split spectra below T f are attributed to Fe spin freezing. The temperature T f decreases with increasing x for y=0.01 while T f increases with increase of y for the samples of x=0.09. The variation of T f is discussed on the basis of RKKY interaction between Fe spins accompanied by FeâCu interaction.",0
"A promising WCâCoâCuâBaF2/CaF2 self-lubricating wear resistant coating was deposited via atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process by using homemade feedstock powders composed of WCâCo, Cu and BaF2/CaF2 eutectic. The as-prepared cermet coatings had better frictional behavior comparing with the WCâCo coating. Moreover, the often-occurred decarburization of WC in APS process was noticeably improved due to the binding of copper and BaF2/CaF2 phase, which not only offered effective solid lubrication, but also acted as bind phases to mend the microstructure and protected WC from decomposition. The optimized specimen contained 10wt.% Cu and 10wt.% BaF2/CaF2 in a WCâCo matrix, which had excellent frictional and wear performance. The wear mechanism of the self-lubricating wear resistant coating was discussed with the microstructures, compositions and mechanical properties of the composite materials in detail.",0
"Near-infrared (NIR) quantum cutting involving the emission of two NIR photons for each visible photon absorbed is realized from Ce3+/Yb3+ codoped chalcohalide glasses. Excitation, emission and decay spectra are measured to prove the occurrence of energy transfer (ET) from Ce3+ to Yb3+. The maximum ET efficiency obtained is as high as 82%, and the possible mechanism of ET is discussed. The directly measured and calculated quantum yield (QY) of the Yb3+ emission upon the excitation of 5d level of Ce3+ is up to 119%.",1
Transparent Ni2+-doped MgOâAl2O3âGa2O3âSiO2âTiO2 glass ceramics were fabricated. The precipitated nanocrystal phase in the glass ceramics was identified by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope. Broadband near-infrared emission centered at 1220nm with full width at half maximum of about 240nm and lifetime of about 250Î¼s was observed with 980nm excitation. The longer wavelength emission compared with Ni2+-doped MgAl2O4 crystal was attributed to the low crystal field occupied by Ni2+ in the glass ceramics. The present Ni2+-doped transparent glass ceramics may have potential applications in broadband optical amplifiers.,1
"Trivalent erbium doped zinc fluorophosphate glasses have been synthesized and their luminescence properties in the green visible range have been investigated as a function of temperature. The JuddâOfelt theory has been used to predict the transition probabilities, branching ratios and lifetimes for the various excited states of Er3+ ions in 0.5mol% of Er2O3-doped glass. The effect of Er3+ concentration on temperature dependent luminescence has been studied for the wide temperature range from room temperature up to 773K. The fluorescence intensity ratio of the green emissions associated to the two transitions from the thermally coupled 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels to the 4I15/2 level of Er3+ ion has been studied as a function of temperature, and in turn used to determine the thermal sensitivity and relative thermal sensitivity of the glasses. In the present study, the maximum value for the thermal sensitivity of 79Ã10â4 Kâ1 at 630K has been obtained for the lowest (0.01mol%) concentration of Er2O3-doped glass, one of the highest sensitivity found in the literature and quite close to the theoretical sensitivity calculated from the JuddâOfelt theory. The results reveal that the zinc fluorophosphate glass having relatively low concentration of Er3+ ions can be useful as an optical temperature sensor due to their high sensitivity and the absence of radiative energy transfer processes.",1
"TiAl-based composites reinforced with different weight fractions of Al2O3 have been successfully synthesized by hot-pressing using the pre-alloyed Tiâ45Alâ7Nb-0.2B and Nb2O5 powders. The microstructures, mechanical and tribological properties of composites were examined. The as-sintered TiAl composites mainly consist of Î³-TiAl phase, Î±2-Ti3Al phase, Î³/Î±2 lamellar colony, TiB2 particles and Al2O3 particles. The microstructure can be refined by synthesizing Al2O3 particles. The volume fractions of Î±2 phase and Î±2/Î³ lamellar colonies increased with the increasing of Al2O3 content. When the Al2O3 content increases to 0.5Â wt %, the composite exhibited the best comprehensive mechanical properties with the yield stress of 1032Â Â±Â 13Â MPa and fracture strength of 2668Â Â±Â 15Â MPa. For the Al2O3/TiAl composites, the fracture type is mainly composed of transgranular, translamellar and delamination fracture. The friction coefficient of 0.5Â wt % Al2O3/TiAl composite is lower than other TiAl composites due to its homogeneous distribution of Al2O3 particles. The main wear mechanism of Al2O3/TiAl composites was determined to be abrasive wear along with plowing grooves. Addition of Al2O3 particles can improve the corrosion resistance of TiAl composites.",1
"The dynamics of a chain particles with competing and anharmonic interactions are investigated. This model exhibits a complex potential energy landscape with exponentially many metastable configurations that are in a one-to-one correspondence with sequence of pseudo-spins (Ising spins). For some pseudo-spin correlation functions, agreement is found between time and canonical averages, i.e. the system behaves ergodically with respect to these functions. The corresponding autocorrelation function exhibits non-exponential relaxation that can be fitted by a stretched exponential. The exponent, Î², varies between 0.6 and 0.75 for different temperatures and the relaxation time, Ï, fits well with an Arrhenius law. Simulating cooling processes, a power-law is found for the residual energy, e res(Î³), as a function of the cooling rate, Î³. These results are discussed in the framework of a one-dimensional kinetic Ising model which is justified microscopically.",0
"The parameters of the crystal electric field (CEF) hamiltonian of the R3+-ions in RNi2B2C (R î¸ Ho, Er, Tm) have been determined from neutron CEF-spectroscopy. These parameters were extrapolated to other lanthanides. The eigen-energies, eigen-states, magnetic single-ion susceptibilities, and magnetic moments in the ordered state were calculated.",0
"Most existing models of ionic conduction in glasses relate the ion transport to some specific structural features. However, there is a lack of investigation concerning the role of the medium range structure on the ionic conduction. In the present paper, with the objective to fill this gap and gain further insights about the microscopic mechanism of ion transport in glasses, the relationship between activation energy of ion transport and the wave number of First Sharp Diffraction Peak (FSDP) has been studied. It is found that the activation energy decreases with the decrease of FSDP wave number. The relationship has been interpreted by using the bond fluctuation model of superionic conductors.",1
"The glasses of the composition 19Na2SO4â20MOâ60P2O5: 1.0Ho2O3/1.0Er2O3 (M=Mg, Ca, and Ba) have been synthesized. Optical absorption and fluorescence spectra (in the spectral range 350â2100nm were studied at ambient temperature. The spectra were characterized using JuddâOfelt theory. From the luminescence spectra, various radiative properties like transition probability A, branching ratio Î² and the radiative life time Ï for blue (B), green (G) and red (R) emission levels of these glasses have been evaluated. The energy transfer between the two rare earth ions (Ho3+ and Er3+) in co-doped Na2SO4âMOâP2O5 glass systems in the visible and NIR regions has also been investigated. Highest intensity, the highest quantum efficiency and maximum energy transfer with low phonon losses of B, G, and R lines has been observed in BaO mixed glasses. The reasons for such higher values of these parameters have been discussed in the light of varying field strengths at the rare earths ion site due to replacement of one modifier oxide with the other. The enhanced intensity of NIR emission (at 2.0Î¼m) has also been discussed in terms of cross relaxation of Er3+ ions from 4I13/2 level to 5I7 of Ho3+ ions.",1
The incorporation of silver nanoparticles into a Yb/Tm codoped ZnOâTeO2 glass is shown to lead to a substantial increase in optically stimulated second harmonic generation (SHG). The corresponding second order optical susceptibility is equal to 1.32pm/V at a wavelength of 1064nm. The optimal conditions required the thermoannealing of the sample for 48h and the use of a pump-probe delaying time of 12ns.,1
"This article reports on the visible upconversion and temperature sensing behaviour of Er3+âYb3+ doped/codoped TeO2âWO3 glasses prepared by a melting and quenching method. The upconversion emissions have been observed throughout the visible and infrared region upon 980nm and 808nm excitations and assigned suitably from different transitions of the Er3+ ion. The emission intensities of the most intense green band have been enhanced on the co-doping with theYb3+ ions with about 5.92 and 3.99 times upon 980 and 808nm excitations, respectively. The reason behind this improvement is explained on the basis of a power dependence study and an energy level structure. The colour tunability behaviour of the codoped glass has also been investigated upon both excitations. The temperature sensing performance of the prepared glass has been studied by using the fluorescence intensity ratio technique up to 745K. The results suggested that the present glass is a suitable candidate for making a high temperature sensor up to 690K with a sensitivity of about 28.72Ã10â4 Kâ1.",1
"The behavior of electronic states in disordered systems subject to a strong nonresonant optical field is investigated theoretically. It is shown that when the optical intensity reaches a critical value which depends on the site-to-site coupling and the standard deviation of the random energy in the disordered system, a sharp transition from localized to extended electronic states takes place.",0
"Glass fiber reinforced cement (GRC) is a composite material produced by the union of a cement mortar matrix and chopped glass fibers. Its good mechanical properties deteriorate with time. This phenomenon has been studied performing a tensile test program on both young and aged samples of GRC produced by using different chemical additives. Once the tests were carried out, a microstructural analysis of fracture surfaces was performed using a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Pictures taken showed that the addition of metakaolin enables more fibers to be pulled out from the matrix instead of being broken in aged GRC samples. However, the increase in the number of such fibers pulled out did not prevent the embrittlement of GRC. Also, all the other chemical additions used did not show any improvement in the mechanical properties of GRC.",0
"We have discovered a new Cu-based bulk metallic glass (BMG). Although of a simple Cu49Hf42Al9 ternary composition, the as-cast alloy is a monolithic, uniform BMG with a critical diameter as large as 10mm. The width of the supercooled liquid region ÎT x and the reduced glass transition temperature T rg for this glass are 85K and 0.62, respectively. In addition to its high glass-forming ability and high density of â¼11g/cc, this BMG exhibits high ductility with a compressive plastic strain of 11â13%, making it a good candidate for applications as well as for studies of deformation behavior of Cu-based BMGs.",0
"In the low temperature regime, the scattering process due to random eigenfrequencies plays an essential role in thermal conductivity and specific heat through the relaxation times. The thermal conductivity obeys a square dependence of the temperature due to the relaxation time of phonon density fluctuations with an inverse temperature. The specific heat obeys a linear dependence of the temperature due to the intraband excitations in addition to a cubic dependence due to phonons; the bandwidth is nearly equal to the inverse relaxation time of atoms from the uncertainty principle.",0
"ABSTRACT Novel recycling technology has resulted in a new type of E-glass fibre product, Fiberlets, recovered from fibre manufacturers' in-house waste. An interesting characteristic is its low aspect ratio, which gives it the ability to pack efficiently, enabling high glass content products to be achieved without an unduly large increase in viscosity that could affect processability. An initial study reported here shows that the material can be used in both thermosetting and thermoplastic moulding materials. Synergistic effects have been found with combinations of Fiberlets and conventional short fibre reinforcement in bulk moulding compounds (BMC). In thermoplastic moulding materials, benefits include improvements in modulus and creep, with the possibility of making readily processable compounds with high inorganic content. Applications therefore include cost-effective BMCs and high glass content thermoplastic moulding materials. Several other uses are envisaged, in applications where milled glass, glass beads and mineral fillers are currently used.",0
"(Zr65Al10Ni10Cu15)100âx Nb x glass forming alloys with Nb contents ranging from 0 to 15at.% were prepared by water-cooled copper mould cast. The alloys with different Nb contents exhibited different microstructures and mechanical properties. Unlike the monolithic Zr65Al10Ni10Cu15 bulk metallic glass, only a few primary bcc Î²-Ti phase dendrites were found to distribute in the glassy matrix of the alloys with x =5. For alloys with x =10, more Î²-phase dendrites forms, together with quasicrystalline particles densely distributed in the matrix of the alloys. For alloys with x =15, the microstructure of the alloy is dominated by a high density of fully developed Î²-phase dendrites and the volume fraction of quasicrystalline particles significantly decreases. Room temperature compression tests showed that the alloys with x =5 failed at 1793MPa and exhibited an obvious plastic strain of 3.05%, while the other samples all failed in a brittle manner. The ultimate fracture strengths are 1793, 1975 and 1572MPa for the alloys with x =0, 10 and 15at.% Nb, respectively.",0
"We report the deformation behavior of the Ni-based bulk metallic glass (BMG) by spark plasma sintering of amorphous powders, which have been prepared by a gas atomization. By spark plasma sintering of amorphous powders in the supercooled liquid region, a fully Ni-based BMG was successfully synthesized. Full densification was achieved by the viscous flow of the amorphous powders in the supercooled liquid region during consolidation process. The strength of about 2.4GPa was obtained in the consolidated BMG, which is comparable to that of the as-cast BMG (2.6GPa). The consolidated Ni-based BMG shows similar super-plastic behavior to the as-cast BMG, indicating that possibility of deformation in the supercooled liquid region.",0
"Although spin glass transitions have long been observed in diluted magnetic alloys, e.g. AuFe and CuMn alloys, previous numerical studies are not completely consistent with the experiment results. The abnormal critical exponents of the alloys remain still puzzling. By employing parallel tempering algorithm with finite-size scaling analysis, we investigated the phase transitions in canonical AuFe alloys. Our results strongly support that spin glass transitions occur at finite temperatures in the alloys. The calculated critical exponents agree well with those obtained from experiments.",0
"Polyester resin enhances its mechanical property when it is reinforced with glass fibres. These glass fibre reinforced polyester composite were widely used in the marine applications. In this research work the polymer composite of three different glass fibres was reinforced with isopthalic polyester resin. By using the volume fraction of glass fibres and polyster resin as 60%-40%, 50%-50% & 40%-60%, various forms of glass fibers such as CSM 450, WRM 610, and COMBO MAT 910 laminates were prepared under each composition. Those Composites were fabricated using hand layup technique and subjected to post curing in a furnace of 80Â°C. The prepared laminates undergoes Barcol hardness test, tensile test, flexural test, water absorption and glass content test to investigate the best combination among the fabricated composites. Based upon the different mechanical property investigation, COMBO MAT 910 was termed as superior than all other laminates.",0
"In this work, we report the near-infrared emission and upconversion of Er3+âTm3+ codoped fluorotellurite TeO2âZnOâZnF2 glasses for different Tm3+ concentrations by using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. A broad emission from 1350 to 1700nm corresponding to the 3H4â3F4 (Tm3+) and 4I13/2â4I15/2 (Er3+) emissions which cover the complete telecommunication window of the wavelength-division-multiplexing transmission systems is observed. The full width at half-maximum of this broadband increases with increasing Tm3+/Er3+ concentration ratio up to a value of~150nm. Energy transfer between Er3+ and Tm3+ ions is also observed and analyzed by both the temporal behavior of the near-infrared luminescence and the effect of Tm3+ codoping on the visible upconversion of Er3+ ions. The addition of Tm3+ reduces the upconverted green emission due to Er3+âTm3+ energy transfer whereas the red emission is enhanced due to the cross-relaxation 3F4â3H6(Tm3+):4I11/2â4F9/2(Er3+) process.",1
"Recently the crystal structure of a germanium-rich dysprosÄ±Ìum germanide (DyGe3) has been reported. Significant bonding interactions are present between the germanium atoms in the structure. One type of germanium forms kinked infinite chains 1 x[Ge]. The remaining two germanium atoms form dimers, stacked in a two-dimensional array as 2 x[Ge2]. DyGe3 raises intriguing questions concerning stability and bonding; these are investigated with the aid of extended HÃ¼ckel calculations. Ge atoms receive electrons from Dy, and Ge states dominate below the Fermi level. There is an interesting electron balance between the two Ge sublattices. The Ge2 layers contain one additional electron, making them formally a Ge- 2 double layer; the one-dimensional Ge chains contain two extra electrons, fitting the typical Zintl picture as Ge2-. The Ge2 double layers exhibit two-center bonding in the pairs, perpendicular to an electron deficient multicenter bonding system within the layers. The latter is responsible for the expected two-dimensional metallic conductivity.",0
"An ultrapure near infrared (NIR) emission entered at 800â¯nm upon 976â¯nm laser excitation (NIR-to-NIR) was observed in Î²-PbF2: Yb3+/Tm3+ glass ceramics (GCs). The ultrapure NIR-to-NIR single band emission originated from the 3H4 â 3H6 transition of Tm3+ with the ratio of NIR emission, and a blue band up to 9633 was obtained. Through detailed analysis of the crystal structure and the energy transfer between Tm3+ and Yb3+, it is elucidated that the host lattice with low phonon energy cooperative with the energy mismatch results in a dramatic population of the 3H4 state as well as ultrapure NIR-to-NIR single band emission. Moreover, up-conversion (UC) emission properties and the decay lifetimes of Î²-PbF2: Yb3+/Tm3+ in GCs were explored thoroughly. The results illustrate that efficient cross relaxation (CR) processes between Tm3+ generate the energy redistribution in UC emission spectra, further concentrating energy to NIR emission. These two issues can be treated as crucial factors on ultrapure NIR-to-NIR single band emission in Î²-PbF2: Yb3+/Tm3+ in GCs. The ultrapure NIR-to-NIR single band emission through 976â¯nm laser excitation is advantageous for enhancing resolution and has potential application in bio-imaging fields.",0
"SiO2 glass doped with Ni2+ and Mn2+ has been prepared by the solâgel process. Very strong visible light (its fluorescence efficiency is about 4 times of that of undoped solâgel SiO2 glass and about 160 times of that of ZnS nanocrystallites) from the SiO2 glass doped with Ni2+ and Mn2+ has been observed. The emission wavelength of Ni2+-doped, Mn2+-doped, and undoped glass samples is about 450 nm. However, the co-doping of Ni2+ and Mn2+ shifts the emission wavelength to 420 nm. The solâgel SiO2 glass is a porous phosphor material. Very strong photoluminescence of the solâgel SiO2 glass mainly comes from structural defects. Because the doped samples contain more Si dangling bonds, nonbridging oxygen, and oxygen vacancy in its structure and surface defects inside the nanometer-scale hole in the solâgel SiO2 glass than undoped glass sample, the fluorescence efficiency of doped samples has been remarkably increased. Because the doped ions affect the band gap structure of the host materials, the emission wavelength of the co-doped samples is different from that of Ni2+- and Mn2+-doped samples. Because the emission wavelength of Ni2+ and Mn2+ luminescent centers in the solâgel silica glass is almost the same as that of undoped sample, the fluorescence intensities of Ni2+- and Mn2+-doped samples are higher than those of the co-doped samples.",1
"In this study, single line scans at different laser powers were carried out using selective laser meting (SLM) equipment on a pre-fabricated porous Al86Ni6Y4.5Co2La1.5 metallic glass (MG) preform. The densification, microstructural evolution, phase transformation and mechanical properties of the scan tracks were systematically investigated. It was found that the morphology of the scan track was influenced by the energy distribution of the laser beam and the heat transfer competition between convection and conduction in the melt pool. Due to the Gaussian distribution of laser energy and heat transfer process, different regions of the scan track experienced different thermal histories, resulting in a gradient microstructure and mechanical properties. Higher laser powers caused higher thermal stresses, which led to the formation of cracks; while low power reduced the strength of the laser track, also inducing cracking. The thermal fluctuation at high laser power produced an inhomogeneous chemical distribution which gave rise to severe crystallization of the MG, despite the high cooling rate. The crystallization occurred both within the heat affected zone (HAZ) and at the edge of melt pool. However, by choosing an appropriate laser power crack-free scan tracks could be produced with no crystallization. This work provides the necessary fundamental understanding that will lead to the fabrication of large-size, crack-free MG with high density, controllable microstructure and mechanical properties using SLM.",0
"The present study demonstrates a facile process for the production of spherical-shaped Cu and Ag nanoparticles synthesized and stabilized by hydrazine and gelatin, respectively. Advantages of the synthetic method include its production of water dispersible copper and copper/silver nanoparticles at room temperature under no inert atmosphere. The resulting nanoparticles (copper or copper/silver) are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UVâvis spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The nanometallic dispersions were characterized by surface plasmon absorbance measuring at 420 and 572nm for Ag and Cu nanoparticles, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy showed the formation of nanoparticles in the range of â¼10nm (silver), and â¼30nm (copper). The results also demonstrate that the reducing order of Cu2+/Ag+ is important for the formation of the bimetallic nanoparticles. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering effects of copper and copper/silver nanoparticles were also displayed. It was found that the enhancement ability of copper/silver nanoparticles was little higher than the copper nanoparticles.",0
"The effects of the efflux tube on the rate of solids flow from a hopper have been studied with glass beads. The rate of flow increased about six times compared with that obtained without a tube. A pressure gradient was produced in the tube by the flow of the solids and the suction effects of this pressure gradient increased the rate of flow of solids. The relation between the negative pressure below the orifice and the rate of flow has been explained satisfactorily by the equation given by Bulsara et al. The introduction of air into the efflux tube below the orifice reduced the effect of the tube, and control of the rate of air introduction gave an easy method for the smooth control of the rate of solids flow.",0
"Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology may be used to produce custom intraradicular posts, but studies are lacking. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the flexural properties (strength and modulus), failure mode, superficial morphology, and roughness of two CAD-CAM glass fiber posts (milled at different angulations) compared with a commercially available prefabricated glass fiber post. Three groups were tested (nâ¯=â¯10): PF (control group)â prefabricated glass fiber post; C-Cdâdiagonally milled post; and C-Cvâvertically milled post. A 3-dimensional virtual image was obtained from a prefabricated post, which guided the posterior milling of posts from a glass fiber disk (Trilor Blanks; Bioloren). Surface roughness and morphology were evaluated using confocal laser microscopy. Flexural strength and modulus were evaluated with the 3-point bend test. Data were submitted to one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test (Î±â¯=â¯0.05). The fractured surfaces were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy. The superficial roughness was highest for PF and similar for the experimental groups. Morphological analysis shows different sizes and directions of the glass fibers along the post. The flexural strength was highest for PF (900.1â¯Â±â¯30.4â¯> C-Cd â 357.2â¯Â±â¯30.7â¯> C-Cv 101.8â¯Â±â¯4.3â¯MPa) as was the flexural modulus (PF 19.3â¯Â±â¯2.0â¯GPa > C-Cv 10.1â¯Â±â¯1.9â¯GPa > C-Cd 7.8â¯Â±â¯1.3â¯GPa). A CAD-CAM milled post seems a promising development, but processing requires optimizing, as the prefabricated post still shows better mechanical properties and superficial characteristics.",0
"In this manuscript, Al2O3 ceramic and TiAl alloy were brazed with Ag-Cu-Ti based composite fillers containing B powder additive. The effects of B content, Ti content, and the brazing temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the brazed joints were investigated. The typical interfacial microstructure of the brazed joint was: Al2O3/Ti3(Cu, Al)3O/Ag(s.s)+TiB+Ti(Cu, Al)+fine AlCu2Ti/blocky AlCu2Ti+AlCuTi/TiAl. TiB whiskers synthesized in situ by the reaction of the B additive with Ti, served as nucleation sites for the formation of fine Ti(Cu, Al) and AlCu2Ti grains and improved the bonding properties. With increasing B content, more fine-grains were formed in the brazing seam and the thickness of the Ti3(Cu, Al)3O reaction layer adjacent to the Al2O3 ceramic decreased. Brazing parameters also influenced the joint microstructure. Growth of Ti3(Cu, Al)3O layer and AlCu2Ti formed with increase in brazing temperature. Moreover, the formation of dispersed fine-grains in the brazing seam depended largely on the initial Ti content in the composite filler. With increase in initial Ti content, the TiB-reinforced area was broadened while the blocky AlCu2Ti content decreased gradually. The maximum shear strength of Al2O3/TiAl joint brazed with B-reinforced composite filler was 148MPa, which was 246% higher than that brazed without B addition. The joint shear strength was determined by the combined influences of the thermal expansion mismatch between the joined materials, the thickness of the Ti3(Cu, Al)3O layer, and the presence of defects in the joints.",0
"The effects of sample thickness on the in vitro bond strength of two light-activated glass polyalkenoate cements to dentine have been investigated. The buccal and/or lingual surfaces of non-carious human third molar teeth were used for bonding. The tensile bond strengths to dentine of samples of the cements of 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm and 2.0 mm were measured 10 min after bonding. For one of the materials bond strength and reliability were found to decrease as the sample thickness increased. The bond strength to dentine of the second material was also affected by changes in the thickness of the cement but as the bond strengths were all very low for this material, any differences are probably of little clinical relevance.",0
"Chopped strand glass fiber reinforced particle-filled polymer composite beams with varying notch-to-depth ratios and different volume fractions of glass fibers were investigated in Mode I fracture using three-point bending tests. Effects of polyester resin content and glass fiber content on fracture behavior was also studied. Polyester resin contents were used 13.00%%, 14.75%, 16.50%, 18.00% and 19.50%, and glass fiber contents were 1% and 1.5% of the total weight of the polymer composite system. Flexural strength of the polymer composite increases with increase in polyester and fiber content. The critical stress intensity factor was determined by using several methods such as initial notch depth method, compliance method and J-integral method. The values of K IC obtained from these methods were compared.",0
"The relaxation process of C60 molecule around glass transition temperature is studied by Monte Carlo simulation, using a new model of the energy barrier of molecule between two orientational states in C60 crystal, which depends on the state of neighboring molecules. The results show that the relaxation is slightly non-exponential, which can be fit to KohlrauschâWilliamsâWatts (KWW) function. The non-exponential factor Î² is 0.962Â±0.002, and this value reproduces the experimental data that has not been explained before.",0
"Magnetisation measurements on FeCr2S4 single crystals revealed a re-entrant behaviour at temperatures below 60K. Sharp spin-glass like changes of zero-field-cooled and thermoremanent magnetisations, coercive force and strong time-dependent magnetisation relaxation below 20K were also found. The observed effects are considered to be a result of fluctuating competing exchange interactions along with the high magnetocrystalline anisotropy of tetrahedral Fe ions strongly antiferromagnetically coupled with Cr ions.",0
"We fabricated three series of glasses in which the Y2O3, Bi2O3 and Al2O3 contents of Bi-doped Y2O3:Al2O3:SiO2 glass were varied. We optimized the content of each component based on quantum efficiency (QE) and other optical properties. The strength of the Bi absorption bands decreased with increasing Y2O3 content. The optimized composition was: 63.5SiO2:22.5Al2O3:13Y2O3:1Bi2O3. With 808nm excitation this glass had a QE, lifetime, emission width and peak of 20%, 375Î¼s, 293 and 1240nm, respectively. The Bi absorption strength had a quadratic dependence on Bi2O3 content. This indicates that the optically active Bi center is Bi2 dimers.",1
"In this work, we investigate the low-energy bands of monolayer WS2 under external electric and magnetic fields using an effective low-energy Hamiltonian. Our calculations indicate that band gap of monolayer WS2 increases linearly with an external perpendicular electric field and when the electric field energy Î z is equal to the size of spin splitting, the band gap including spinâorbit interaction of the monolayer increases to its band gap as the case of without spinâorbit interaction. In the presence of the magnetic field, spin splitting energy in the conduction and the valence bands at the valleys depends strongly on the magnetic field. In this work, the optical properties of monolayer WS2 are also calculated by using the EhrenreichâCohen formula. Our estimation for the square of the interband matrix element for transitions near the K points is in good agreement with previous calculations.",0
"We have studied the dynamic susceptibility in a quantum spin glass which is described by an Ising model in a transverse field, the latter introducing quantum effects in an otherwise classical problem, using the mean field theory. It is shown that the frequency of the peak of the susceptibility shifts towards higher values of Ï, its amplitude is reduced and peaks are broadened, as quantum effects strengthen. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the experimentally studied crystal-field-split system of LiHo x Y1âx F4 by Wu et al.",0
"The martensitic transformation in dilute Fe-Ni alloys was firstly investigated by using a composition gradient in the range from 0 to 31 mass% Ni. The current study exhibited the transformation of austenite to equiaxed or acicular ferrite at lower Ni contents can be suppressed and lath martensite can form. The electron backscattered diffraction results showed Ni has important effect on misorientation distribution in martensite. With the increase of Ni content up to â¼27.5 mass%, the misorientation distributions above 15Â° increased, and a peak at around 7Â° gradually disappeared. With the further increase of Ni content, two peaks between about 50Â° and 60Â° at low Ni contents changed into three peaks at high Ni contents and a new peak at around 17Â° arose due to formation of plate martensite. Moreover, it was observed that both block and sub-block was refined with increasing Ni content. Moreover, the micro-hardness/strength of martensitic Fe-Ni alloys between previous works and this work and the micro-hardness of martensite between Fe-C and Fe-Ni alloys were compared and discussed.",0
The magnetomechanical coupling coefficient (k) of amorphous Fe73.5Cu1Nb3Si15.5B7 alloy strips was investigated after annealing them in vacuum for 1 h at temperatures ranging from 300 to 560Â°C. The maximum values of k coefficient (k m = 0.62) were observed for annealing at 540Â°C and k m = 0.46 for 560Â°C when the nanocrystallization process was advanced. For as-quenched samples k m was equal to 0.15â0.20.,0
"In this paper, we clarify the gel-to-glass (G-G) transformation behavior of the sol-gel derived xAl2O3-(100â¯ââ¯x)SiO2 (xâ¯=â¯0, 10, 20 and 30â¯mol) systems by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The SiO2-Al2O3 gels exhibit lower G-G transition temperature than the pure SiO2 reference gel. Adding Al2O3 to the SiO2 gel can suppress the dependence of glass transition temperature (T g) on hydroxyl concentration, and this effect is attributed to the highly cross-linked structure in alumina-silica gels. In addition, the Al-rich phase separates from the Si-rich matrix phase, and such immiscibility increases with increasing Al2O3 content. This behavior is similar to that of the melt-quenched alumina-silica glasses.",1
This paper focuses on the resin flow characteristics of nanoclay filled glass fiber laminates processed by Vacuum Assisted Resin Infusion Molding (VARIM). Laminates with varying quantities of nanoclays (0â5wt.%) were prepared and the effect of these nanoclays on the epoxy resin flow characteristics was studied. It was found that the flow rate of resin continuously decreased as nanoclay content continuously increased. The reduction in the flow rate was attributed to the rate of change of curing and the subsequent change in viscosity of the nanoclay filled resin. Analysis of infusion process by Darcyâs law show that the permeability of the fiber decreased in the nanoclay filled resin system. Nanoclay filled laminates show improved static and dynamic mechanical properties than that of unfilled resin composites.,0
"Fluoroquaternary glasses within system 70TeO2-10ZnO-10NaF-(10â¯ââ¯x)MoO2-xEr2O3 doped with different concentration of xEr2O3 ions were prepared by using melt- quenching technique. The amorphous nature of the glasses confirmed by using X-ray diffraction. Physical parameters viz.: density (Ï), molar volumes (V m), refractive index (n), an optical energy gap (Eg) and Urbach energy (ÎE) values of prepared glasses were evaluated. Moreover, the JuddâOfelt parameters Î©2, Î©4, Î©6, the oscillator strength type transition probabilities, Smeas, Scal, spectroscopic quality factors, X, branching ratio, Î²R and radiative lifetimes, ÏR, of several excited states of Er3+ have been computed. The gain cross-section of laser transition level from 4I13/2â¯ââ¯4I15/2 and stimulated emission cross-section estimated with different concentration of Er2O3 ions in all present glasses. Here the spectroscopic properties indicate that these glasses doped with Er3+ are a promising candidate for optical applications.",1
"We report the optical properties and upconversion emissions from the Er3+ ions in a ZrF4-based glass system ZrF4âZnF2âAlF3. JuddâOfelt intensity parameters (Î©(t) with t=2,4,6) were obtained by analyzing the room temperature absorption spectrum. Upon 800 nm laser excitation, upconversion fluorescence was observed in blue, green and red regions at both 25 and 300 K. The main mechanism appears to be energy transfer among Er3+ ions in excited states. The green and red emissions result from a two-step process while the blue one is owing to a three-step energy transfer process.",1
"Previously acquired data on the non-linear susceptibilities of a Pd Mn spin-glass, which exhibited clearly the effects of critical slowing down close to the spin-glass temperature, are shown to display scaling behaviour over the entire temperature range examined if the recently proposed prescription of Levy (in which the ratio of susceptibilities is plotted) is adopted.",0
"Effects of fibre coating (size) on transverse cracking has been investigated. Two glass fibre/vinyl ester model composites were studied, denoted CA and NoCA and based on different size compositions. Various single fibre tests were not able to quantify the interfacial failure of CA as the interface never failed. The CA size consisted of a film former and a methacrylsilane-coupling agent whereas the NoCA size did not contain any coupling agent. The study reveals limitations with single fibre composite tests for fibre/matrix combinations with high interfacial toughness. Cross-ply laminates based on NoCA demonstrated significant inferior transverse cracking toughness as compared with CA laminates. Composites based on commercially sized glass fibre were also investigated and they performed almost as poorly as the NoCA material, demonstrating large potential for improvement in commercial composites. Results further indicate that the remarkable transverse cracking toughness of the CA material stems partly from strong fibre/matrix adhesion but also from high ductility of the matrix region close to the fibre surface.",0
"In the present paper, in situ synthesized 10vol.% TiC/TA15 composite has been fabricated by induction melting and common casting utilizing the reaction between titanium and C powder. Three types of heat treatment processes were performed on the as-cast composite and, accordingly, fine fully lamellar, bi-modal and near-equiaxed microstructures were obtained. The tensile properties were tested at room temperature, 600Â°C and 650Â°C. The results show that heat treatment can evidently enhance UTS below 600Â°C. The increased UTS is accompanied by the rapid decrease in tensile elongation at room temperature. As tensile temperature increases to 650Â°C, the discrepancy in UTSs of the composite with different matrix microstructures becomes small. The composite with fine fully lamellar microstructure exhibits a good combination of relatively high UTS and high tensile elongation in comparison with that with bi-modal and near-equiaxed microstructures. Below 650Â°C, the damage of the composite before and after heat treatment is mainly initiated by the fracture of TiC particles followed by the ductile failure of the matrix.",0
"Concrete is one of the most widely consumed materials in the world. It is composed mainly of natural aggregates - 70â80% of its volume. Extraction of natural aggregates for concrete production harms the environment, and has decreased over the past years. The use of recycled aggregates that can replace natural aggregates in concrete and meet the specifications of structural projects can be an economical and sustainable solution for the construction industry. This study investigated the effects of partial replacement of natural aggregates (pebbles) with glass foam (10â30 %wt), produced with soda-lime glass wastes, rice husk ash and calcium carbonate, on the uniaxial compression strength (3, 7, 28, 56, and 90 days) and consistency (Slump test) of structural concrete. Results show that the larger the size and concentration of the recycled aggregates, the lower the mechanical compressive strength of concrete. Hence, the highest compressive strength at all ages was shown by the material with 4.8mm glass foams and 10% addition - 38MPa after 90 days. Furthermore, partial replacement positively favors the slump of concrete (>90mm), enabling its commercialization and workability for pumping from mixer trucks.",0
"The Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped silicate-germanate glasses with good thermal properties were synthesized by high temperature melting method. 2.0â¯Î¼m emissions with broad effective half-width (231.5â¯nm) were successfully obtained in present Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped glasses without obvious quenching upon excitation of a commercial 808â¯nm laser diode. To further understand 2â¯Î¼m fluorescence behaviors of the prepared glasses, energy transfer mechanism, efficiency, rate and microparameters from different levels of Tm3+ to Ho3+ ions have been obtained and discussed. In short, the Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped silicate-germanate glass with excellent spectroscopic properties might be an attractive host material for 2â¯Î¼m broadband solid laser.",1
"High-field magnetization curves are presented for AuFe alloys of Fe concentrations: c = 3.1, 5.1, 6.5 and 10.4 at.%, at T = 4.2 K in pulsed fields up to 40 T. For c = 10.4 at.% additional data were taken at T = 1.2 K and 77 K. From these results we conclude that the nearest-neighbour interaction between the Fe atoms in Au is ferromagnetic, of order of 80 K. The behaviour of the magnetization curves can be qualitatively explained in terms of ferromagnetic clusters that are antiferromagnetically coupled.",0
We study the four dimensional (4D) Â±J Ising spin glass in a magnetic field with the simulated tempering algorithm recently introduced by Marinari and Parisi. We compute numerically the order parameter function P(q) and analyze the temperature dependence of the first four cumulants of the distribution. We discuss the evidence in favor of the existence of a phase transition in a field. Assuming a well defined transition we are able to bound its critical temperature.,0
"We calculate thermodynamic properties of a disordered model insulator, starting from the ideal simple-cubic lattice (g=0) and increasing the disorder parameter g to âª¢1/2. As in the earlier Einstein and Debye approximations, the ground state energy is discontinuous at g c =1/2. For g<g c the low-T heat-capacity Câ¼T 3, whereas for g>g c , Câ¼T. The van Hove singularities disappear at any finite magnitude g of the disorder. For g>1/2 we discover novel fixed points in the self-energy and spectral density of this model glass.",0
"A large-sized CuZr-based bulk metallic glass (BMG) composite with enhanced mechanical properties is prepared successfully. With the addition of Ta to CuZr-based alloys, the critical composite size changes and the microstructure diversifies. The composite with 0.5Â at.% Ta addition has the largest critical size with the microstructure of single CuZr(B2) phase uniformly dispersing in amorphous matrix. This composite exhibits good mechanical properties, i.e., large compressive plasticity and work-hardening ability, which should be attributed to the uniformly distributed CuZr(B2) phase. The increased critical size of CuZr-based BMG composite can be explained by the fact that proper Ta addition can suppress the precipitation of crystalline phases other than B2 CuZr phase during solidification. This study may be helpful for the fabrication of large-sized BMG composites with excellent mechanical properties.",0
"Gd3+-, Tb3+/Gd3+-coactivated oxyfluoride borogermanate scintillating glasses with the density of about 6.35â6.61g/cm3 were prepared by a melt-quenching method. The luminescent and energy transfer properties were studied by transmittance, photoluminescence and X-ray excited luminescence (XEL) spectra. The total content of rare-earth oxide and fluoride is as high as 49mol% in oxyfluoride borogermanate glasses, which are necessary to ensure their density up to 6.61g/cm3. Energy transfer efficiency and mechanism from Gd3+ to Tb3+ were determined, and the corresponding critical distances for both Gd3+âTb3+ and Tb3+âTb3+ ion pairs were calculated, respectively. The optimal concentration of Tb3+ ions in dense oxyfluoride borogermanate glasses excited by both ultraviolet light and X-ray excitation were also determined. The integral scintillation efficiency of Tb3+-activated borogermanate scintillating glass was found to be about 26.9% of the standard Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) scintillating crystal.",1
"The objective of this study is to determine the tensile behaviour of a unidirectional E-glass/polyester composite in relation to the strain rate. Several orientations of fibres in the composite are tested with an hydraulic tensile machine, which covers a range of loading rate from quasi-static up to approximately 20 m/s. It is shown that experimentally and numerically, high velocity entails specific difficulties. In this study, some tests were improved in order to limit these effects and to obtain directly reliable material properties. The composite studied is quasi-unidirectional, the influence of 5% vol. of weft fibres is evaluated at quasi-static strain rate. It is found that the presence of the weft fibres is the source of the damage development. Longitudinal (0Â°) and transverse (90Â°) orientations of fibres in the composite are tested. The effects of strain rate on mechanical properties (maximum stress, Young's modulus, strain to failure) are noted. Damage mechanisms seem to evolve with the strain rate.",0
"Coatings made from neat vinyl ester and nanoclay reinforced vinyl ester composites are applied onto individual glass fibers as well as rovings to evaluate their barrier resistance against alkali and moisture attack. The fibers coated with clay nanocomposites present a significantly less damage caused by the diffusing alkali ions, giving rise to a much higher residual tensile strength after aging than the fibers without coating or those with a neat polymer coating. The static fatigue test performed on individual fibers verifies the advantage of using nanoclay composite to retard the corrosion process under the combined stress and alkaline environment. Similar beneficial effects of incorporating nanoclay on residual strength are identified for impregnated fiber bundles. The above observations confirm the excellent barrier characteristics of intercalated/exfoliated nanoclay in polymer that are applied in composite structures on both the microscopic and macroscopic scales.",0
"The moisture uptake characteristics of unfilled and filled lyester resin at 60Â°C are reported. The objective was to determine the influence of filler on the moisture uptake properties of unfilled polymer. Diffusivity in the filled polyester is lower than in the plain resin. However, the filled resin absorbs significantly more water than unfilled polyester. Tensile load was found to have no effect on the water uptake in plain polyester. However, moisture absorption was affected by tensile load in 20% (by volume) bead-filled polyester and in SMC-R65. Increasing load increased the diffusion coefficient in SMC-R65. Combining rules predicted the diffusion coefficient in unloaded SMC-R65, but could not account for changes in diffusivity caused by tensile loading. In bead-filled polyester, the diffusion coefficient was accurately predicted when microstructural effects were accounted for.",0
"Calcium phosphate glasses were prepared by adding Nb2O5 and Na2O. Spectroscopic analyses showed that the glasses included niobate groups, such as NbO4 and NbO6. The amount of NbO4 units, which was considered to be a network former, increased with the increase in Nb2O5 content, and the formation of an NbâOâP bond appeared. The ion-releasing ability of the glasses in the Tris-buffer solution depended on their chemical composition. The process window of the glass, which was estimated from the temperature range between the glass transition and the onset of crystallization, increased with the increase of the Nb2O5 content of the glass. The excellent chemical durability and glass-forming ability of calcium phosphate glass were considered to originate from the formation of the NbâOâP bond.",1
"In this paper, Dy3+ doped SrCO3âWO3âSiO2 glass ceramics are successfully prepared by melt-quenching method. The microscopic morphology, structure and luminescence properties of Dy3+ doped glass ceramics are investigated through XRD, DSC, SEM, photoluminescence spectra and decay curves etc. It can be determined that the crystalline phase is SrWO4 after comparing with PDF normal card by XRD. Also, combining with the transmission curves, the optimum heat treatment temperature and time are 740Â Â°C/1.5Â h. In the emission spectrum, there are three obvious emission peaks at 484Â nm, 575Â nm and 665Â nm, respectively. The optimum concentration of Dy3+ is found to be 1.6Â mol, and electric multipole interaction is the main reason for the concentration quenching. The maximum fluorescence lifetime is 796.5Â Î¼s.",1
The electronic structures of binary metallic glasses CuxZr1âx have been studied using a first-principles OLCAO method and a quasi-periodic model containing 90 atoms. The model is constructed by computer relaxation technique and the calculated pair correlation function compares well with experiment. The calculated density of states and its value at the Fermi level are in good agreement with experimental measurements. Analysis of the wave functions indicates the states at the Fermi level are delocalized.,0
"The aim of the research analyses the durability of concrete by Portland cement, silica fume (SF) & ground granulated blast furnace (GGBS). Here, mineral admixtures like GGBS and Silica fume are partially replaced with cement in concrete. Silica fume and GGBS are replaced with varying proportions of 0, 10, 20, 30%. Here, M40 grade of concrete is used for mix design and 0.5% of Alkali resistant (AR) type Glass fibers are also added to the total volume of the concrete. The present article investigates the detailed study of split tensile, bending, compressive strength of the concrete and comparing is done with control concrete.",0
"This paper introduces the use of a simplex-centroid design method, together with a ternary contour diagram, to evaluate the effect of blending different proportions of soda lime glass powder (GP), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and calcium aluminate cement (CAC) on the compressive strength, alkali-silica reaction (ASR) expansion, drying shrinkage and high temperature resistance of alkali-activated cement (AAC) mortars prepared with the use of crushed glass cullet (GC) as aggregates. The relationship between performance of the geopolymer and precursor composition was established. It was found the ASR expansion increased with the increase of GP content and the addition of CAC as the replacement of GGBS could significantly reduce the ASR expansion. The drying shrinkage increased with the increase of GGBS contents. The residual strength coefficient of the mortars after high temperature exposure increased with the increase of CAC content and could be higher than 100%. And the strength coefficient increased with the increase of GP content resulted from its partial melting at the high temperature. It was found that the GP content should be in the range of 77â90%, the GGBS content should be lower than 5% and the CAC content should be higher than 10% to achieve acceptable ASR expansion and drying shrinkage.",0
"The Tb3+-doped gadolinium calcium silicoborate (BSGdCaTb) glasses of composition (55-x) B2O3 - 10 SiO2 - 25 Gd2O3 -10 CaO -x Tb2O3, where xÂ =Â 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0Â mol %, have been prepared by conventional melt quenching technique and are characterized through thermal, absorption, excitation, emission and decay rate measurements. The optical band gap (Eopt) and Urbach's energies (ÎE) have been evaluated taking into account the ultraviolet (UV) edge of absorption spectra. The Tb3+ -doped BSGdCaTb glasses exhibit strong emission in the green (5D4Â âÂ 7FJ, JÂ =Â 3,4,5 and 6) and very weak emission in the ultraviolet blue (5D3Â âÂ 7FJ, JÂ =Â 3,4,5 and 6) transitions under excitation at 275Â nm, respectively. The intensity of the 5D4Â âÂ 7F5 (green at 543Â nm) and 5D3Â âÂ 7F4 (blue at 436Â nm) emissions and their integrated intensity ratios (IG/IB) and (IB/IG) under 275Â nm excitation have been obtained as a functions of Tb3+ concentration, respectively. The emission intensity of Gd3+ at 312Â nm decreases with increasing of Tb2O3 concentration, while emission intensity of Tb3+ increases upto 1.0Â mol % concentration of Tb2O3. The Tb3+ ion decay time for 5D4 level has been determined and is found to be slightly decreases with increasing of Tb2O3 concentration. The CIE color coordinates and color purity have been calculated for Tb3+-doped glasses and it have found to be shift towards the bright green region with increasing of Tb3+ ion concentration in BSGdCaTb glasses.",1
"RÃ©sumÃ© Les principales formes histologiques du cancer du col utÃ©rin sont le carcinome Ã©pidermoÃ¯de et lâadÃ©nocarcinome.

"The dynamics of a disparate-size binary liquid near the glass transition are investigated within a mode-coupling theory. The density-relaxation functions and the susceptibility spectra of the large particles are similar to those of a one-component system, the latter consisting of a large Î±-peak, a Î²-peak with low intensity and a microscopic peak. In the susceptibility spectra of the small particles, a Î²-peak which is higher in its maximum than the Î±-peak was found. The appearance of the large Î²-peak reflects the motion of the small particles in an almost static random potential produced by the large particles.",0
"In this paper, the spin-lattice coupling coefficient G 11 for Mn2+ in the cubic phase of a CsCaCl3 crystal has been calculated from the three microscopic mechanisms which contribute to zero-field splitting. Based on this, the local rotation angle Æ(T) for Mn2+ in the tetragonal phase of a CsCaCl3 crystal is estimated from the EPR zero-field splitting b 2 0(T). The reasonableness of the local rotation angle is discussed.",0
"The compressive and tensile deformation, as well as the fracture behavior of a Zr59Cu20Al10Ni8Ti3 bulk metallic glass were investigated. It was found that under compressive loading, the metallic glass displays some plasticity before fracture. The fracture is mainly localized on one major shear band and the compressive fracture angle, Î¸ C, between the stress axis and the fracture plane is 43Â°. Under tensile loading, the material always displays brittle fracture without yielding. The tensile fracture stress, Ï F T, is about 1.58 GPa, which is lower than the compressive fracture stress, Ï F C(=1.69 GPa). The tensile fracture angle, Î¸ T, between the stress axis and the fracture plane is equal to 54Â°. Therefore, both Î¸ C and Î¸ T deviate from the maximum shear stress plane (45Â°), indicating that the fracture behavior of the metallic glass under compressive and tensile load does not follow the von Mises criterion. Scanning electron microscope observations reveal that the compressive fracture surfaces of the metallic glass mainly consist of a vein-like structure. A combined feature of veins and some radiate cores was observed on the tensile fracture surfaces. Based on these results, the fracture mechanisms of metallic glass are discussed by taking the effect of normal stress on the fracture process into account. It is proposed that tensile fracture first originates from the radiate cores induced by the normal stress, then propagates mainly driven by shear stress, leading to the formation of the combined fracture feature. In contrast, the compressive fracture of metallic glass is mainly controlled by the shear stress. It is suggested that the deviation of Î¸ C and Î¸ T from 45Â° can be attributed to a combined effect of the normal and shear stresses on the fracture plane.",0
"Effect of CaF2 addition at the expense of CaO on the thermal, physical, optical and structural properties of glasses in the NaPO3âCaO system was studied. The glasses were prepared by the conventional melt quenching method. For each glass, the thermal properties were studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and the optical properties by UVâVis-NIR spectroscopy. The changes in the glass structure induced by the progressive replacement of CaO by CaF2 were investigated using IR and Raman spectroscopies. The glasses were heat treated at 20Â°C above their respective glass transition temperature for 17h to form nuclei and then at their peak crystallization temperature for 1h to grow the nuclei into crystals. An increase in the CaF2 content increased the polymerization of the phosphate network leading to shift of the band gap to lower wavelength and reduced the crystallization tendency of the glasses. At least two crystalline phases precipitated in all the investigated glasses, the composition of which depended on the CaF2 content. Finally, bulk crystallization was suspected to occur in the oxyfluorophosphate glasses.",1
"The scaling behaviour of vortex-glass superconductivity is studied, by measuring the resistive transition as well as the I-V curve under a variety of magnetic fields, in a series of V doped YBa2Cu3O7ây samples with different grain sizes. The equilibrium phase boundary line between the normal and superconducting phases in the H-T plane obtained by fitting the resistive transition is consistent with that obtained by the I-V curve measurements. As the magnetic field is lower than a certain value, H s, the scaling exponents are magnetic-field independent, but at H = H s, they begin to increase with the magnetic field and gradually get saturation. The switch field, H s, decreases with decreasing the grain size in the samples. The results show that the magnetic-field-dependent scaling behaviour of the I-V curve observed in weak-link containing systems originates from the transition of a âweakâ vortex-glass state to a âstrongâ vortex-glass state.",0
"Potassium tetragermanate gel (K2O4GeO2) was synthesized by hydrolytic polycondensation of germanium ethoxide with potassium ethoxide in alcoholic medium. The crystallization behavior of the gel, examined by differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction, is reported and discussed. Potassium tetragermanate gel crystallizes in two steps. At about 593Â°C, metastable K4Ge9O20 crystals are formed as the major crystalline phase with a small amount of K2Ge4O9 crystals. At higher temperatures, metastable K4Ge9O20 are converted to the thermodynamically stable K2Ge4O9 phase. These results are compared with those of conventionally prepared glass of the same composition.",1
"We investigated the fluorescence characteristics of Er codoped Nd doped ZBLAN glasses proposed for solar pumped fiber laser (SPFL) under simulated sunlight. Er is used as a sensitizer because it absorbs a part of the ultraviolet and visible light where is no absorption of Nd. Under simulated sunlight illumination, Er singly doped fluoride glass displayed four emission bands with peaks at 550, 848, 977 and 1533nm attributed to the 4S3/2-4I15/2, 4S3/2-4I13/2, 4I11/2-4I15/2 and 4I13/2-4I15/2 electronic transitions of Er, respectively. The quantum efficiency measurement was carried out using an integrating sphere and under the simulated sunlight excitation showed a maximum of 73% for 0.5mol.% of ErF3 in ZBLAN glass. In Nd, Er codoped fluoride glass, the 1.05Î¼m emission of Nd was observed under 380nm excitation what supposes the energy transfer from Er to Nd in ZBLAN glasses as Nd has no absorption at the wavelength. Er, Nd codoped fluoride glasses are promising as a sensitized laser media for solar pumped fiber lasers.",1
"A pultruded unidirectional carbon/glass (core/shell) hybrid rod of 19â¯mm in diameter was developed for marine applications. To understand the long-term evolution of the mechanical properties of the rod in service, a pressure chamber device with adjustable hydraulic pressure and a self-designed interfacial shear strength (ISS) setup were developed. Immersion in water was performed at 20â¯Â°C, 40â¯Â°C, and 60â¯Â°C without hydraulic pressure or at 60â¯Â°C with a hydraulic pressure of 20â¯MPa for one year. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was conducted to analyse the thermal properties of the hybrid rod. Post curing, indicated by the increase in the glass transition temperature (Tg), was pronounced during immersion. ISS of the shell, core and shell/core interfaces was sensitive to water immersion and decreased after 360 days. A linear decrease of ISS with the exposure temperature was observed. The hydraulic pressure had a positive effect on ISS, especially for the GFRP shell. The evaluation of the long-term behaviour indicated that ISS will decrease to a stable level of 74.8% for glass fibre/resin, 57.8% for carbon fibre/resin and 69.9% for the interface between the carbon fibre core and the glass fibre shell.",0
"A series of pseudo-quinary Ti20Zr20Hf20Be20(Cu20-x Ni x ) (x =2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 and 20at.%) high entropy bulk metallic glasses (HE-BMGs) with large glass forming ability (GFA) were successfully prepared by copper mold tilt-casing. The critical diameters (D c) of these HE-BMGs are all above 12mm. In particular, the developed Ti20Zr20Hf20Be20(Cu7.5Ni12.5) and Ti20Zr20Hf20Be20Ni20 high entropy alloys (HEAs) can be produced in the amorphous state with diameters up to 30mm and 15mm, respectively, which are the largest HE-BMG and quinary HE-BMG hitherto. The two HE-BMGs also exhibit high yield strength, together with the plastic strain values of (3.0Â±1.1) % and (4.0Â±0.9) %, respectively. With increasing Ni additions in the pseudo-quinary HEAs, the crystallization growth resistance and thermal stability have been improved, which is apparently due to the sluggish diffusion of the atoms in the HEAs.",0
"We study the order of the phase transition in the 3d U(1)+Higgs theory, which is the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. We confirm that for small scalar self-coupling the transition is of first order. For large scalar self-coupling the transition ceases to be of first order, and a non-vanishing scalar mass suggests that the transition may even be of higher than second order.",0
"A quinary Ti20Zr20Hf20Be20Cu20 high entropy bulk metallic glass (HE-BMG), with a critical diameter (D c) of 12Â mmâthe largest size in the reported quinary high entropy alloys (HEAs), has been successfully prepared by copper mold casing. This novel HE-BMG possesses a supercooled liquid region ÎT (=T xÂ âÂ T g) of 78Â K, indicating a better thermal stability than those of other HE-BMGs. In addition, the HE-BMG exhibits a relatively good compressive plasticity (2.2Â Â±Â 0.1%) among the HE-BMGs. The newly developed HE-BMG may offer insights for the indepth understanding of the fundamental issues associated with the glass formation and the unique structure-property relationship when combining the features of HEAs and BMGs together.",0
"The vortex-glass to vortex-liquid transition has been investigated by measuring the linear complex ac impedance of c-axis oriented YBa2Cu3O7âÎ´ (YBCO) thin films exposed to a magnetic field H parallel to the c-axis using a two coil mutual inductance technique. An analysis of the films frequency- and temperature-dependent resistance R(Ï, T) and inductance L(Ï, T) in terms of dynamic scaling in three dimensions provides strong evidence for a genuine continuous phase transition. Regardless of the value of H, we find the static (v) and dynamic (z) critical exponents v = 2.0 Â± 0.5 and z = 5.5 Â± 1.0, in good agreement with values inferred from other studies of YBCO thin films, but distinctively larger than those reported for single crystals.",0
"The magnetization behavior of frozen ferrofluids shows a typical glassy behavior, e.g., a maximum in the zero field cooled magnetization at T m; irreversibility and longtime relaxation of residual magnetization, but is distinct from those of canonical spin glasses. They exhibit many similarities with concentrated and re-entrant spin glasses and some with random magnetic anisotropy systems, for which the inhomogeneity of magnetic structure is a characteristic feature. It is suggested that a phase with weak irreversibility, ranging from T Ì f <2T m , is determined by magnetic clusters. A crossover to a phase with strong irreversibility at the fictitious freezing temperature T Ì f is deduced from the change of T m(H)-characteristic in conjunction with the onset of magnetic hysteresis. The variance of dipole interaction ãE 2 dd ã1/2 for randomly ordered frozen moments were calculated for the investigated ferrofluids. The result T mâ2ãE 2 dd ã1/2 supports the hypothesis of the existence of clusters with non-randomly ordered moments around T m. From the field dependence of the relaxation behavior and from the ratio T Ì f /ãE2 ddã1/2 it was concluded that the ferrofluid with an extended net-like aggregate structure enters in the state with strong irreversibility at significantly higher rescaled temperatures, rather than those with compact, isolated particle clusters.",0
"Physical, optical and luminescence properties of lithium aluminium phosphate (LAPSm), sodium aluminium phosphate (NAPSm) and potassium aluminium phosphate (KAPSm) glasses doped with 0.5 mol% of Sm2O3 have been investigated. The results found that all glass samples are clear, homogenous and transparency. The optical absorption spectra are shown strong absorption bands in the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) region for all doped samples. The emission spectra of all doped glass samples exhibited four peaks correspond to the energy transition 4G5/2 â 6H5/2 (562 nm), 4G5/2 â 6H7/2 (597 nm), 4G5/2 â 6H9/2 (644 nm) and 4G5/2 â 6H11/2 (704 nm) have been observed under 401 (6H5/2 â 6P3/2) nm excitation wavelength. Also, the CIE chromaticity analysis yields reddish-orange light emission for all glass samples. It was observed that the emission intensity LAPSm glass is higher than NAPSm and KAPSm glasses. Hence LAPSm glass could be considered as a good optical glass for Sm3+ dopant for reddish-orange emission material.",1
"Measurements of conductivity (AC and DC), dielectric constant Îµâ²(Ï) and dielectric loss Îµâ²â²(Ï) have been made for bulk glassy samples of Se55Ge30As15 alloy in the frequency range from 10kHz to 10MHz and within the temperature range from 350 to 500K. The DC conductivity shows an activated behavior above 370K, giving a conduction activation energy ÎE=0.83eV. The AC conductivity Ï ac (Ï) was found to be temperature independent and vary as Ï s with s=0.994, where s is the frequency exponent. The charge-transfer process explained via CBH model with centers of intimate valence alternation pairs (IVAPs) type, giving a maximum barrier height W M=2.23eV and density of localized states N (E F)=1.67Ã1020 cmâ3. The dielectric constants behavior, reveal that the tested bulk Se55Ge30As15 chalcogenide exists in the form of molecular dipoles which remain frozen at low temperatures and, as the temperature is increased, the molecules attain freedom of rotation at temperatures above 370K. The experimental results also gave a direct evidence of the existence of a Debye-type relaxation having a wide distribution of relaxation times. The most probable value of a spread of relaxation times have been estimated as Ï=4.13Ã10â6 s.",1
"In this study, five different types of six layered GFRP laminates were prepared from three types of resin systems and compared for their intermediate velocity bullet impact response. The first panel was made of epoxy resin, second one is of hybrid resin (a blend of 60% epoxy and 40% polyester) and the remaining three panels were made of hybrid resin with MWCNT in three different proportions by weight (0.1%, 0.5% and 1.0%). The composite and nano-composite panels were characterized experimentally for the important issues in the field of aerospace engineering, like medium velocity bullet impact response and vibration damping characteristics. The MWCNTs were responsible for greater characteristics improvement in the hybrid resin due to their high tendency to absorb the impact shock. The panels without MWCNT turn out to be lesser shock absorption capability. Additionally, 0.1% MWCNT hybrid panel shows exceptional damping response by damping the impacted vibration within 9.5 ms. There is also a 175.51% increase in the damping ratio of the panel. The higher percentage MWCNTs show lesser response towards damping of vibration. This may be due to the lengthy entangled structure of MWCNTs in the resin. It is also observed that the impacted damage is higher in the epoxy system panel than the nano-composite panel.",0
"Structural and photoluminescence properties of Dy3+ doped lithium fluoro-borate glasses with the compositions Li2B4O7âBaF2âNaFâMO (where M=Mg, Ca, Cd and Pb), Li2B4O7âBaF2âNaFâMgOâCaO and Li2B4O7âBaF2âNaFâCdOâPbO have been investigated through XRD, FTIR, optical absorption, emission and decay measurements. From the optical absorption spectra, JuddâOfelt intensity parameters (Î© Î» , Î»=2, 4 and 6) have been evaluated and are in turn used to predict radiative properties such as radiative transition probabilities (A T), branching ratios (Î² r) and stimulated emission cross sections (Ï p) for all emission levels of Dy3+ ion in different lithium fluoro-borate glass matrices. From the emission spectra, chromaticity color coordinates have been calculated and indicated emission color for all glass matrices. The nature of decay profiles of 4F9/2 state of Dy3+ in all the glass matrices are analyzed.",1
"Nanoparticle modifications of glass-ionomer cement are interesting research subjects. This study investigated the effect of MgO nanoparticles on the setting time, compressive and diametral tensile strength, and adhesive properties of glass-ionomer cement. A conventional GIC was modified by the incorporation of MgO nanoparticles at 1%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (w/w) ratios with an unmodified GIC used as the control group. The data were analysed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's HSD test (pâ¯<â¯0.05). Although the GICs with 1% and 2.5% MgO nanoparticles were still within the ISO standard range specified for the GIC setting time, increasing the MgO nanoparticle concentration significantly increased the setting time of the tested cement (pâ¯<â¯0.05). GICs with 1% MgO nanoparticles had the highest compressive and diametral tensile strength values. Increasing the nanoparticle content from 5% and more significantly decreased the cement strength (pâ¯<â¯0.05). The shear bond strength (SBS) of enamel and dentine showed statistically significant differences among the tested groups (pâ¯<â¯0.05). However, the addition of MgO nanoparticles up to 5% (w/w) did not have an unfavourable effect on the cement adhesiveness. Although cohesive and mixed type failure modes were more common than adhesive failure modes, no statistically significant associations were found between the failure mode and type of GIC (pâ¯>â¯0.05). Within the limitations of this study, the current findings suggest that modifying GICs by incorporating MgO nanoparticles up to 2.5% (w/w) could be a promising restorative material for clinical dental applications.",0
"The effects of pre-compression treatment at room temperature on the microstructures, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance in the seawater solution of Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have been investigated. The amount and size of B2-CuZr nanocrystallites precipitated from the glass matrix increase with enhancing the pre-compression stress, which suggests that the appropriate pre-compression treatment promotes the formation of metallic glass matrix composites (MGMCs). The 850MPa pre-compressed MGMC possesses the highest compressive fracture strength (1814MPa) and a certain degree of plasticity, as well as the larger hardness of 700HV. The 1415MPa pre-compressed MGMC with more B2-CuZr nanocrystallites demonstrates advantages in thermal stability and corrosion resistance in the seawater solution. It shows the higher corrosion resistance with the most positive corrosion potential and the lower corrosion current density than the other tested samples. These can be attributed to the structural homogeneity after appropriate precipitation of nanocrystallites.",0
"The third-order optical nonlinearity was measured in bismuth-based glasses by Z-scan technique using femto-second laser pulses. Re(Ï (3))=4.9Ã10â11 esu at 748nm was obtained in the glass containing 65.5mol% of Bi2O3. Although, the wavelength dependence of Re(Ï (3)) shows resonant effect significantly, relatively small nonlinear absorption coefficient Î² =0.8cm/GW at 769nm was estimated. Bismuth-based glass exhibits the largest third-order optical nonlinearity in oxide glasses, indicating they are promising materials used for nonlinear optical devices.",1
"Microstructure formation in as-cast, wrought and as-rolled Tiâ45Alâ9NbâY alloys has been investigated, and near lamellar, near duplex and near gamma structures were observed, respectively. The investigation included the evolution of the Î²/B2-phase in these three differently processed Tiâ45Alâ9NbâY alloys. Omega-phase occurs on the expense of the Î²/B2-phase in the hot deformed Tiâ45Alâ9NbâY alloy. Moreover, Î³ laths precipitate in Î²/B2-phase when the alloy was hot rolled. After canned forging, a tweed like contrast which is perpendicular to the orientation of lamellae occurs in the coarsened Î± 2 laths in residual lamellae. In addition, a rod-like microstructure which is composed of the Î± 2 and Î³-phase has been observed in as-rolled alloy. The grain size of this material is a little larger than that of the as-forged alloy, but rather smaller than of the as-cast alloy.",0
"Bioinspired surfaces are fabricated by integrating chemistry, physics, and nanotechnology methods, e.g., soft lithography, imprinting, nanoimprint lithography, nanocrystalline technology, fabrication of ZnO, dip coating, fluid-coating, gradient geometry fabrication, microfluidics technology for fabrication of materials, self-assembly, wet assembly, self-assembly of wax crystals for bioinspired superhydrophobic surfaces, wet assembly of bioinspired bead-on-string structures, electrospinning technology, electrochemistry, fabrication of nanostructures and wettability, composite nanotechnology including fabrication of bioinspired spun silk, and patterning of controllable surface wettability for printing techniques. In general, we introduce those techniques and concepts with a focus on the micro- and nanostructures that mimic biological surface functionality and fabrication of bioinspired materials and functional surfaces.",0
"This paper addresses the influence of the addition of short, dispersed fibres made of alkali-resistant (AR) glass and carbon on the fracture behaviour of textile-reinforced concrete (TRC). A series of uniaxial, deformation-controlled tension tests was performed to study the strength, deformation, and fracture behaviour of thin, narrow plates made of TRC with and without the addition of short fibres. Furthermore, multifilament-yarn pullout and single-fibre pullout tests were carried out to gain a better understanding of the crack-bridging behaviour which suppresses growth and widening of cracks. Pronounced enhancement of first-crack stress was achieved, the value increased by factors of 1.5 and 2 due to the addition of glass and carbon fibres, respectively. While more and finer cracks were observed on the specimens with short fibres added, a moderate improvement in tensile strength was recorded. Water-to-binder ratio influences the matrixâfibre bond quality and thus fibre failure mode. While fibre fracture dominated behaviour when matrix M030 (low water-to-binder ratio of 0.30) was used, pronounced pullout behaviour was observed for fibres embedded in the matrix with a higher w/b ratio (M045). Furthermore, it was found that short fibres can also improve the bond between multifilament-yarns and the surrounding matrix by means of new cross-links.",0
"Glasses are of special interest nowadays mainly because of the large applications that they span. Raman spectroscopy is an experimental technique appropriate for providing information about the structure of local arrangements of the atoms in glasses. The influence of CaO content on the structure of borate glasses was investigated by Raman spectroscopy. At low calcium oxide content the structure of calcium borate glass consists mainly of boroxol groups and a smaller number of pentaborate groups. In the vitreous network there are few diborate groups, chain type metaborate groups and pyroborate groups. At high calcium oxide content, pentaborate, orthoborate and metaborate groups appear. The increase of calcium oxide content yields an increase in number of non-bridging oxygen ions. Therefore, we conclude that calcium ions act as network modifiers in borate glasses.",1
The time-independent magnetization of a Cu-Mn alloy (9 at% Mn) as an isothermal function of field is found to describe an S-shaped curve indicative of a field-induced transition. The critical field for the transition decreases to zero as the temperature is raised to that of the susceptibility cusp.,0
"The aim of this research is to manufacture intermingled hybrid composites using aligned discontinuous fibres to achieve pseudo-ductility. Hybrid composites, made with different types of fibres that provide a balanced suite of modulus, strength and ductility, allow avoiding catastrophic failure that is a key limitation of composites. Two different material combinations of high strength carbon/E-glass and high modulus carbon/E-glass were selected. Several highly aligned and well dispersed short fibre hybrid composites with different carbon/glass ratios were manufactured and tested in tension in order to investigate the carbon ratio effect on the stressâstrain curve. Good pseudo-ductile responses were obtained from the high modulus carbon/E-glass composites due to the fragmentation of the carbon fibres. The experimental results were also compared with an analytical solution. The intermingled hybrid composite with 0.25 relative carbon ratio gave the maximum pseudo-ductile strain, 1.1%, with a 110GPa tensile modulus. Moreover, the initial modulus of the intermingled hybrids with 0.4 relative carbon ratio is 134GPa, 3.5 times higher than that of E-glass/epoxy composites. The stressâstrain curve shows a clear âyield pointâ at 441MPa and a well dispersed and gradual damage process.",0
"The electronic structures of the random binary alloys Î³-Fe1âx V x and Î³-Fe1âx Mn x with x = 0, 5 and 10 at% calculated in the canonical hybridization band (CHB) approximation using the ASA-CPA method. The effect of Mn and V-impurities on magnetic state of Î³-Fe is discussed.",0
"Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped phosphate glasses with different concentrations of Tm3+ were prepared by high-temperature melting method. The up-conversion (UC) emission spectra of the samples were measured under 975nm excitation. The blue UC emission at 477nm in the sample doped with 0.5mol% Tm3+ is very strong. By analyzing the power spectra and population processes of the UC emission, we found that photon avalanche phenomenon has existed in the energy transition between Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions, which results in the strong blue UC emission at 477nm. By this way, the luminous efficiency of the materials doped with Tm3+ will be greatly improved. Our research will be helpful in developing UC emission materials.",1
"The effects of Cu substitution for Fe on the glass-forming ability (GFA) and soft magnetic properties for Fe72âx Cu x B20Si4Nb4 (x=0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are investigated. It is found that the investigated BMGs exhibit large GFA as well as excellent soft magnetic properties, and proper substitution of Fe by Cu improves the saturation magnetization, coercive force, and effective permeability without obvious deterioration of the GFA.",0
Glass fibre-reinforced Polyurethane networks suitable for formation by RIM having T g between 133 and 145Â°C are prepared on the bench by reacting 4-4'-di(isocyanato phenyl) methane and tetrol at 40Â°C and subsequently cured at 150Â°C. Hammer-milled glass fibres are incorporated in four volume fractions (Ï f ) up to 0.158. These samples are fractured by using a falling weight impact machine. The fractured specimens are studied in a scanning electron microscope to understand the impact results. The study reveals that the fracture is of brittle nature and the fibres are weakly bonded with the Polyurethane matrix.,0
"The effects of alkaline earth ions as network modifiers on the broad near infrared (NIR) emission from bismuth doped aluminophosphsilicate glasses were investigated. The results showed the intensity of NIR emission peaked at 1300Â nm increased with increase in the radius of alkaline earth ions, while those of NIR emission peaked at 1100Â nm and red emission from Bi2+ vary in an opposite tendency. We propose that particular emission performance of Bi result from the abnormal reduction phenomenon of Bi ions by SiO2âP2O5âAl2O3âRO (RÂ =Â Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, SPAR) glass hosts, which became effective with the order of MgOâCaOâSrOâBaO. Then the origins of infrared-emitting bismuth centers were discussed according to the effect of alkaline earth ions on the conversion of Bi ions.",1
"Fluoro-silicic mica glassâceramics were prepared by a sintering process and different proportions of nano-ZrO2 particles (3Y-TZP) were integrated during the process. Bending strength and fracture toughness were evaluated using a three-point bending test and a Vickers indenter, respectively. The bending strength and fracture toughness improved in significantly with the increase in the quantity of nano-ZrO2 additives. The highest bending strength of 324.3Â±12.3MPa and fracture toughness of 4.2Â±0.11MPam1/2 were obtained with 30% (wt.) nano-ZrO2. Good results were also obtained in morphological observations. The glassâceramic is homogenous and the ZrO2 grains embed in the lamellar structures of the fluoro-silicic mica homogenously and completely and array well and compactly. On the fracture surface, both the transgranular fracture and the intergranular fracture can be observed clearly.",1
"The dielectric and electrical properties of Se 100 - x S x glasses ( x = 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 and 20) were carried out in the frequency range 0.12â100kHz and temperature range 303â393K. The frequency dependence of the AC conductivity is found to obey the modified form of the universal power law, Ï â² = Ï 0 + A Ï s + B Ï s â² . The analysis provides an indication of charge hopping mechanism. The influence of composition on the investigated parameters has been reported and attributed to the effect of sulfur fraction on the defect states.",0
"We review the results of neutron scattering studies of the static and dynamic spin fluctuations in crystals of La2âx Sr x CuO4+Î´ in the doping regime intermediate between the NÃ©el and superconducting regions. In this regime the in-plane resistance is linear in temperature down to Ï80 K with a crossover due to logarithmic conductance effects at lower temperatures. The static spin correlations are well described by a simple model in which the inverse correlation length K(x,T=K(x,0)+K(0,T. The most dramatic new result is the discovery by Keimer et al. that the dynamic spin fluctuations exhibit a temperature dependence which is a simple function of Ï/T for temperatures 10 K â©½Tâ©½500K for a wide range of energies. This scaling leads to a natural explanation of a variety of normal state properties of the copper oxides.",0
"Amorphous Al80Ni8Fe4Gd8 quaternary powders are successfully produced using the mechanical alloying (MA) technique, suggesting that powder metallurgy techniques may be used in the manufacture of aluminum-transition metal-rare earth metallic glasses as high-strength, low-density engineering materials. Detailed investigations into the microstructural evolution of the amorphous phase from elemental powders are presented, employing scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as, analytical techniques. The results show that it is possible to amorphize higher-order systems by MA, and the observations of the amorphization reaction support the interdiffusion-based model developed from studies of simple binary systems, with certain adjustments. The resulting amorphous powder demonstrates good thermal stability, and consolidated amorphous bulk material up to 93% dense are easily produced. Mechanical properties of the amorphous phase are evaluated, including measurement of Vickers hardness and fracture toughness. K c is found to lie in the range of 1â5 MPa/M 1 2 , identifying the produced powder as the brittle-type amorphous phase seen in earlier work. Dispersed ductile nanocrystals improve the fracture toughness at the expense of Vickers hardness.",0
"RÃ©sumÃ© Les auteurs rapportent le cas dâun jeune patient victime dâune plaie thoracique par arme blanche. Le tableau clinique rÃ©alisÃ© Ã©tait celui dâune tamponnade aiguÃ«.

"Microhardness, hot hardness, uniaxial compression, and notched bending experiments were conducted on Cu60Zr20Hf10Ti10 bulk metallic glass (BMG). This Cu-based BMG possesses near theoretical strength but essentially zero compressive ductility at room temperature. Notch toughness values in excess of 65 MPaâm were obtained, while significant softening was obtained near T g .",0
"The oxidation of SiC in SiCâborosilicate glass composites releases gases which cause a high volume expansion ratio and low bending strength and limits the application of the composites as packaging materials. To solve this problem, we deposited a Ti compound coating on SiC by heating a mixture of TiH2 and SiC particles at 750Â°C for 1h under vacuum. The thickness of the coating was about 200nm, and the coating was a gradient TiCâTi5Si3âTiSi2 barrier layer according to the result of the X-ray diffraction. The coated SiC had a better anti-oxidation ability than uncoated ones in borosilicate glass, and as a result, the volume expansion ratio of the composites with 25vol.% coated SiC was reduced by 287%, and the bending strength was increased by 117%. The composites with 55vol.% SiC had the maximum thermal conductivity (14.2Wmâ1 Kâ1) and rather low thermal expansion coefficient (4.98Ã10â6).",0
"In the present study varying thickness of (5-25mm) E-glass composite laminates have been prepared through hot compression moulding method using different matrix systems such as phenolic and epoxy with E-glass fiber as a common reinforcement. The laminates were initially evaluated for their mechanical and mode-I inter laminar fracture energy as per ASTM test methods. It is observed that the laminate having epoxy matrix has shown higher mechanical and fracture energy than the laminate made using phenolic matrix. This is due to the strong adhesion bond between the epoxy matrix and glass fiber reinforcement. Further, the laminates were subjected to ballistic impact tests against 7.62X 39 mild steel projectiles. It is observed that the laminate having lower fracture energy (E-glass/phenolic) has shown better energy absorption under ballistic impact. Failure analysis on post impacted laminates have been studied using C-scan analysis and observed that E-glass/epoxy composite laminate has shown limited damage area, whereas E-glass/phenolic composite laminate has shown more damage area. This study reveals that the laminate having lower fracture energy for delamination is more suitable for higher energy absorption due to dissipation of energy in lateral directions under ballistic impact conditions.",0
"Cu47Ti33Zr11Ni6Sn2Si1-based bulk metallic glass matrix composites reinforced with tungsten wires were fabricated by infiltration process at different temperatures (850, 900, 950 and 1000 Â°C) and time (10, 20 and 30 min) in a quartz or a steel tube. The mechanical tests were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that the maximum strength and total strain of the composite are 1778 MPa and 2.8% fabricated in steel tube at 900 Â°C for 10 min, and 1582 MPa and 3.6% fabricated in quartz tube at 850 Â°C for 10 min, respectively.",0
"For protein chip construction, the chemical properties for the surface of glass slides have to be elaborately modified for protein immobilization. To immobilize proteins, plasma polymerized hexamethyldisiloxane (PPHMDSO) thin film was deposited onto the surface of glass slide. Previously, it was reported that proteins were immobilized onto PPHMDSO thin film [H. Miyachi, A. Hiratsuka, K. Ikebukuro, K. Yano, H. Muguruma, I. Karube, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 69 (3) (2000) 323â329]. Here, we modified PPHMDSO-coated glass slide by an additional oxygen plasma treatment with placing the patterned mask on the HMDSO-coated glass slide. Hydrophilic surfaces were detected by measuring the contact angle of water. Of great interest, proteins were strictly immobilized on the patterned O2 plasma treated areas, providing more efficient ways for fabricating the protein chips.",0
"Flaws may be created in composite materials during manufacturing, machining, or use. Composites with such flaws, when subjected to adverse environmental conditions in the presence of a sustained load, may have reduced mechanical properties and changes in their microstructural properties up to failure. E-glass/vinyl ester composite coupons with a single edge flaw have been conditioned for periods up to 7900 h at room temperature and at an elevated temperature, with and without a sustained load, to determine the changes in the tensile properties and damage mechanisms which occur with the introduction of the flaw. The early damage mechanisms have been found to change from transverse matrix cracking, fiber cracking, and occasional edge delaminations for unnotched specimens to the growth of a significant matrix crack from the notch tip and well-defined longitudinal tow debonding for notched specimens.",0
"We investigated UV absorption changes induced in 3.5mol% Ge-doped fused silica at high-intensity (â¼1011â1013 W/cm2) femtosecond (130fs) irradiation at 267, 400 and 800nm. We have shown that the induced spectra in the region 190â300nm are similar in all three cases. At 800nm irradiation, in addition to the UV absorption changes, we observed small-scale damage due to self-focusing. This damage appears when the incident pulse fluence value of about 1J/cm2 (pulse intensity of about 7.5Ã1012 W/cm2) is overcome, while the threshold for the induced absorption changes is twice lower.",1
"Polarized neutron techniques were used to observe history-dependent effects in the re-entrant spin glass (Fe0.65Ni0.35)1â x Mn x on both a macroscopic and a mesoscopic length scale. The temperature dependence of the mean magnetization and of the thermo-remanent magnetization were simultaneously determined for0.11 < x < 0.14, along with estimates of the size of the ferromagnetic clusters or micro-domains. For two samples (x = 0.11 and 0.12) the magnetic texture of magnetized and unmagnetized samples could be determined. The detailed behaviour strongly depends on the Mn concentration x.",0
"In this work, a series of WS2/ZnIn2S4 composite photocatalysts containing different WS2 cocatalyst amounts were prepared through a facile hydrothermal approach. The prepared WS2/ZnIn2S4 composite photocatalysts were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UVâvis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), and their visible-light driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performances were also investigated. It was revealed that the loading of WS2 cocatalyst could greatly boost the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of ZnIn2S4, and the 3% WS2/ZnIn2S4 sample achieved the highest hydrogen production rate of 199.1Â Î¼mol/h/g, which was nearly 6 times higher than ZnIn2S4 and was even comparable to the conventional Pt/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. The improved photocatalytic performance of WS2/ZnIn2S4 could be ascribed to the promotion of separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers derived from the heterostructure formed at the interface between ZnIn2S4 and WS2. Thus, this work proves a great potential of WS2 as a cost-effective cocatalyst for semiconductor-based photocatalytic hydrogen production.",0
"Introduction of underlayer is one of the mitigation methods commonly used for the suppression of the Sn whiskering phenomenon in electronic packaging. The presence of a proper underlayer prevents the intermetallic compound formation resulting from a Cu/Sn interaction believed to be the major driving force of Sn whisker growth. Ni as an underlayer has been widely studied and industrially accepted. However, Ni underlayer suffers from its polycrystalline grain structure where grain boundaries can potentially act as a diffusion path for the Cu/Sn interaction to take place. In this study, a 100-nm-thick Zr46Ti26Ni28 thin film metallic glass (TFMG) is introduced to block the Cu/Sn interaction. Samples with and without TFMG underlayer were aged at room temperature for up to 33days in ambient atmosphere. No Sn whisker is observed in the sample with TFMG underlayer after aging. In contrast, Sn whiskers are found in the absence of the underlayer and the whisker density increases with increasing aging time. It is found that TFMG underlayer plays an important role in effectively suppressing Sn whisker growth.",0
"The large size, crack-free Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 bulk metallic glass (BMGs) with the diameter of 54âmm and the height of 15âmm was built by laser solid forming additive manufacturing technology, whose size is larger than the critical diameter by casting. The microstructure, tensile and compressive deformation behaviors and fracture morphology of laser solid formed Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 BMGs were investigated. It is found that the crystallization mainly occurs in the heat-affected zones of deposition layers, which consist of Al5Ni3Zr2, NiZr2, ZrCu, CuZr2 phases. The content of amorphous phase in the deposit is about 63%. Under the compressive loading, the deposit presents no plasticity before fracture occurs. The fracture process is mainly controlled by the shear stress and the compressive shear fracture angles of about 39Â°. The compressive strength reaches 1452âMPa, which is equivalent to that of as-Cast Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 BMGs, and there exist vein-like patterns, river-like patterns and smooth regions at the compressive fractography. Under the tensile loading, the deposit presents the brittle fracture pattern without plastic deformation. The fracture process exhibits normal fracture model, and the tensile shear fracture angle of about 90Â°. The tensile strength is only about 609âMPa, and the tensile fractography mainly consists of micro-scaled cores and vein-like patterns, dimple-like patterns, chocolate-like patterns and smooth regions. The results further verified the feasibility and large potential of laser additive manufacturing on fabrication and industrial application of large-scale BMGs parts.",0
"The crystallization behavior of Zr41Ti14Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 bulk metallic glass (Vit1 BMG) under the action of high-density pulsing current (HDPC) have been studied experimentally. It has been found that high-density pulsing current can directly induce the rapid nanocrystallization of Vit1 BMG. The multiple crystallization processes of Vit1 BMG induced by HDPC have been confirmed as AmorphousâAmorphous+i-phaseâBe2Zr+Zr2Cu+Ni7Zr2 +FCC phase+other phasesâZr2Cu+Ni7Zr2 +FCC phase+other phases. By comparing to the crystallization behavior of Vit1 BMG induced by isothermal annealing, the crystallization temperature is reduced and crystallizing process is significantly shortened, while the sequence of crystallization process in both cases is basically same. The present results show that the HDPC has significantly influenced the crystallizing kinetics of Vit1 BMG due to that it can greatly promote the movement and rearrangement of atoms, which will result in a rapid nanocrystallization. It suggests that HDPC treatment can be an effective way to induce the rapid nanocrystallization of BMGs.",0
We report two new magnesium-rich glassy Mg-Ca-Zn alloys of one eutectic (Mg72Ca12Zn16) and another near eutectic (Mg63Ca15Zn22) composition. The glass-forming ability of the alloys is slightly lower than that of the Mg60Ca5Zn35 alloy which has been well explored earlier. The Young's Modulus of the new glassy alloys is exceptionally low (~35â¯GPa) and much lower than that of the Mg60Ca5Zn35glassy alloy (~50â¯GPa) indicating possible potential biomedical applications.,0
"In the present study, the stress gradient is shown to significantly affect the deformation behavior of a monolithic bulk metallic glass (BMG) at room temperature under tensile loading. It is demonstrated that the stress concentration areas of the BMG specimens facilitate the formation of shear bands, and the presence of âsoftâ and âhardâ regions due to the stress gradient confines the propagation. With these stress gradients, brittle monolithic BMGs exhibit plastic deformation at the stress concentration areas under tensile loading, and higher orders of stress gradient result in larger confinement for the propagation of shear bands. The findings are significant in controlling the plastic deformation behavior of BMGs and in understanding the deformation mechanisms of monolithic BMGs under complex stress states, which is important for potential engineering applications.",0
"In this paper, we have studied the evolution of the photoluminescence (PL) emission from CdS quantum dots embedded in silica glass with time. An increase of PL emission with time was observed due the passivation of non-radiative recombination centres. Annealing of the samples in different environments (oxygen, hydrogen, and air) seems to reduce the PL emission, due to the activation of non-radiative defect states.",1
"Strain rate effect on the mechanical behavior of a Cu48Zr48Al4 bulk metallic glass composite (BMGC) containing a B2-CuZr phase was investigated under quasi-static and dynamic compression. It was found that the CuZr-based BMGC exhibits remarkable strain-rate-softening, although the deformation-induced martensitic transformation of the B2-CuZr phase similarly occurred under both quasi-static and dynamic loading. The significant transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and pronounced work-hardening characteristic of the BMGC upon quasi-static loading were found to be considerably deteriorated under dynamic loading. Furthermore, the BMGC alloy was aboratively heat-treated into austenite and martensite states mainly containing the B2-CuZr phase and the B19â²-CuZr phase respectively. By comparing the strain-rate responses of the mechanical behaviors in the austenite and martensite states, it was shown that the B2-CuZr phase itself presents dynamic softening due to the deformation-induced martensitic transformation with heat release effect. The dynamic softening characteristic of the B2-CuZr phase limits its contribution to the potential mechanical behavior of the CuZr-based BMGC containing the B2-CuZr phase under dynamic loading.",0
"Millikelvin magnetoconductance studies performed in mesoscopic spin-glass n+-Cd1âx Mn x Te wires reveal strong effects of Mn spins upon universal conductance fluctuations. In particular, scattering potential of the frozen spins leads to magnetic and thermal irreversibilities of the fluctuation patterns. Slowly fluctuating spins, on the other hand, are an efficient source of conductance noise providing a real-time probe of spin dynamics.",0
"We have investigated the spatial distribution of magnetic atoms (Mn or Fe) by determining the short range order parameters for the archetypal spin-glass alloys: Cu Mn, Au Mn, Au Fe and Pt Mn in the dilute limit. All four systems possess atomic short-range order (ASRO) such as to enhance local ferromagnetic regions. In the latter three systems the ASRO is relatively strong and initiates long-range structures which develop with increasing concentration and which eventually destroy the spin-glass state.",0
"The impact and flexural post-impact behaviour of ternary hybrid composites based on epoxy resin reinforced with different types of fibres, basalt (B), flax (F), hemp (H) and glass (G) in textile form, namely FHB, GHB and GFB, has been investigated. The reinforcement volume employed was in the order of 21â23% throughout. Laminates based exclusively on basalt, hemp and flax fibres were also fabricated for comparison. Hybrid laminates showed an intermediate performance between basalt fibre reinforced laminates on the high side, and flax and hemp fibre reinforced laminates on the low side. As for impact performance, GHB appears to be the worst performing hybrid laminate and FHB slightly overperforms GFB. In general, an increased rigidity can be attributed to all hybrids with respect to flax and hemp fibre composites. The morphological study of fracture by SEM indicated the variability of mode of fracture of flax and hemp fibre laminates and of the hybrid configuration (FHB) containing both of them. Acoustic emission monitoring during post-impact flexural tests confirmed the proneness to delamination of FHB hybrids, whilst they were able to better withstand impact damage than the other hybrids.",0
"Nd3+/Ho3+ co-doped silicate-germanate glass has been synthesized by high temperature melt-quenching method. Near infrared emission centered at 2Âµm has been successfully obtained by incorporating Nd3+ and Ho3+ in present glass. The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters Î©t (t=2, 4, 6), and radiative properties of Ho3+ were calculated and discussed by using the Judd-Ofelt theory. The energy transfer processes and luminescence properties of Nd3+/Ho3+ co-doped glasses were analyzed pumped by a conventional 808nm laser diode. Desirable spectroscopic characteristics indicates that Nd3+/Ho3+ co-doped silicate-germanate glass might be a good alternative matrix for 2Âµm band mid-infrared laser.",1
"This study compared shear bond strengths of porcelain laminate veneers, fabricated on refractory dies, which were lengthened incisally by 0.5 mm. Specimens were divided into four separate groups. In group A, the teeth were reduced 0.5 mm and the bonding was to enamel. The teeth of the remaining groups were reduced 1.0 mm and the bonding was to dentin. For two of the groups glass ionomer liners were applied before etching. Bonding to enamel was best, with cohesive fractures in porcelain. In the other groups, failure was adhesive in nature, occurring at the resin-tooth interface.",0
"The effect of different post-cure conditions on the mode I fracture toughness of a vinylester resin and its glass-fibre reinforced composite counterpart has been studied. Two sets of parameters were investigated. The first was the post-cure duration at constant temperature; 90Â°C for 1, 4 and 24h. The second, for resin toughness only, was a combination of post-cure temperature and duration; 90Â°C/4h, 80Â°C/8h and 70Â°C/16h. The results show that the post-cure increases toughness. This trend is consistent between the pure resin and the fibre composite for all treatments, except at 90Â°C/24h. It is believed that the prolonged post-cure duration of 24h has weakened the bond strength at the fibreâmatrix interface, thus reducing the effectiveness of toughness transfer from the matrix to the composite. The study concludes that the post-cure enhances the toughness of the glass-fibre/vinylester composite, mainly due to the increase of resin toughness.",0
Neutron scattering and susceptibility measurements are used to study magnetic ordering in EuxSr1âxS near the onset of ferromagnetism at x c = 0.51. The results provide evidence for a spin-glass state even above x c up to x â 0.65 at low T.,0
"Vibrational spectroscopy provides direct information about the structural arrangement of glass networks such as degree of polymerization of network-forming polyhedra and structural arrangements of silicate-germanate, silicate-borate, and related ternary glasses. The Raman spectrum provides a probe for the onset of crystallization in some glasses and for the identification of metastable phases that crystallize from glasses.",1
"A set of co-doped (Ce3+/Dy3+): LBZ glasses were prepared by standard melt quenching technique. The pertinent absorption bands were observed in the optical absorption spectrum of co-doped Ce3+/Dy3+: LBZ glasses. We have been observed a prominent blue and yellow emission pertaining to Dy3+ ions at 0.5Â mol % under the excitation of 385Â nm doped glasses. However, the photoluminescence intensities were remarkably enhanced by co-doping with Ce3+ ions to Dy3+: LBZ glasses due to energy transfer from Ce3+ to Dy3+. The emission spectra of co-doped (Ce3+/Dy3+): LBZ glass exhibits three strong emissions at 440Â nm, 480Â nm and 574Â nm which are assigned with corresponding electronic transitions of 4I15/2Â âÂ 6H15/2, 4F9/2Â âÂ 6H15/2 and 4F9/2Â âÂ 6H13/2 respectively. The Commission International de E'clairage coordinates were calculated from their emission spectra of single doped Dy3+ and co-doped (Ce3+/Dy3+): LBZ glasses. The obtained CIE chromaticity coordinates for optimized co-doped glass are found to be very close to the standard white region. Based on the concentration of Ce3+, the emitting color of the co-doped glass can be changed from blue to white color. The transformation of the color from blue to white region due to energy transfer from Ce3+ to Dy3+. The energy transfer mechanism was substantiated by various fluorescence dynamics such as overlapped spectral profiles, photoluminescence, lifetime decay and CIE color coordinate analysis. These results could be suggested that the obtained co-doped (Ce3+/Dy3+): LBZ glasses are promising candidates for commercial white light applications.",1
"We report the fabrication of a carbon nanotube silica composite. This inorganic composite is produced with the solâgel technique and deposited in thin films by the dip-coating method. The functionalization of multiwall carbon nanotubes is a decisive step in order to introduce them inside a silica matrix. Functionalization ensures good homogeneity of multiwall carbon nanotubes. Atomic force microscopy and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy demonstrate the well dispersion at the nanometer scale and a micrometer scale, respectively. Moreover, AFM measurements show carbon nanotubes are present in individualized form.",0
Measurements of the muon spin rotation in an Niî¸Ti glassy metal-hydrogen system are reported. The muon depolarization rate is found to be due to the coupling of the muon spins and hydrogen nuclear moments. Motional narrowing occurs above about 150 K and takes place in two stages. It is suggested that the depolarization rate can best be described if it is assumed that the motion of the muon is faster than that of the hydrogen in the first stage of the narrowing. In the second stage the increase of temperature causes the hydrogen diffusion rate to overtake that of the muon and the fluctuation of the dipole fields at the muon is due principally to the motion of the hydrogens.,0
"For the investigation of the crystallization behavior of the glass with the composition 2MgOâ2Al2O3â5SiO2, corresponding to stoichiometric cordierite, according to the addition of CeO2 as a flux, the maximum nucleation and crystal growth rates were determined by observing the microstructure of the crystallized glass with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystallization mechanism was also studied by an isothermal method using differential thermal analysis (DTA). The glass transition temperature (T g) decreased with the CeO2 addition and only Î±-cordierite was precipitated as a main crystal phase without Î¼-cordierite for all heat treated glasses containing CeO2. The maximum nucleation and crystal growth rates were 2.4 Î¼m â3 h â1 at 800Â°C and 0.3 Î¼mh â1 at 915Â°C, respectively. The activation energy value E obtained from isothermal method was 88.9Â±9.1 kcalmol â1 , and the Avrami constant n was 1.08Â±0.27, which indicates a surface growth mechanism through an interface reaction.",1
"The microstructure and superior mechanical properties of bulk nanocrystalline FeâAlâC alloys made by mechanically alloying (MA) with subsequent spark plasma sintering (SPS) were investigated. Three kinds of nanocrystalline Feâ24 at% AlâXat%C (X=1,2,4) alloy powder were produced by MA from iron and aluminum powder with addition of methanol, and were subsequently consolidated at 1073â1273 K under 64 MPa by SPS. These compacts have the relative densities of 99.97% (1at%C) to 99.5% (4at%C). The structure of compacts with 1at%C is composed of grains of Fe3Al of 1.5 Î¼m in diameter and nano Îº-carbides (Fe3AlC0.5) precipitates, while those of compacts with 2 and 4at%C are composed of nanocrystalline Fe3Al of about 80 nm in diameter, nano Îº-carbides and small amount of large Î±-grains of about 1 Î¼m in diameter. These structures maintain the nanostructure even at 973 K, that is, they have the good thermal stability. The mechanical properties of these compacts were measured by compression tests at room temperature (RT) to 973 K in vacuum. The compacts with 1 and 2at%C of this work perform the superior mechanical properties (e.g. yield strength of 2150 MPa and rupture strain of 0.14 for compact with 2at%C at R.T.) when compared with the ordinary Fe3Al casting (e.g. the yield strength of 380 MPa and rupture strain of 0.12).",0
"We investigated enthalpy and dielectric relaxation behaviors in the glass transition region of polypropylene glycol of molecular weight 1000 and 4000 by measuring both dynamic heat capacity and dielectric susceptibility as a function of frequency and temperature. The data at each temperature were fitted to the KohlrauschâWilliamsâWatt (KWW) relaxation function, and the relaxation time, the shape parameter Î², and the relaxation strength were extracted. The relaxation times follow the same VogelâTammannâFulcher (VTF) equation for both enthaply and dielectric responses, while Î² of the KWW relaxation function showed different temperature dependences. Î² of the enthalpy relaxation shows a linear temperature dependence, whereas it stays constant in the dielectric relaxation. Significant molecular weight dependence occurs only in the relaxation strength. We discuss the temperature dependence of the shape parameter in terms of broadening of the relaxation time distribution associated with cooperative molecular rearrangements.",0
"EXAFS studies of reversible photostructural changes in bulk As and Ge chalcogenide glasses have been performed. The compositions studied were Ge33Se67, Ge40Se60, Ge40S60, As40S60 and As43S57. The magnitude of the photostructural change in both germanium and arsenic systems is larger in off-stoichiometry samples. In the AsS system the structural change is characterised by an increase in the AsSAs bond angle, whereas in the GeS (Se) systems a bond-breaking mechanism dominates. These data are consistent with neutron scattering and electron spin resonance data.",1
"Tiâ47Alâ2.5Vâ1Cr intermetallic alloy was fabricated by the laser melting deposition (LMD) manufacturing process. The microstructure was characterized by OM, SEM, TEM and XRD. The tensile properties and Vickers microhardness were evaluated on both longitudinal and transverse directions. Results showed that full density directionally solidified (DS) columnar grain with fully lamellar (FL) microstructure consisted of Î³-TiAl and Î±2-Ti3Al lamellae was formed in the as-laser deposited samples along the longitudinal direction due to the high thermal gradient. The room-temperature tensile strength of the as-deposited alloy is up to approximately 650MPa in the longitudinal direction and 600MPa in the transverse direction, while the tensile elongation on both directions is approximately 0.6%. The tensile fracture surfaces are different for the longitudinal and transverse directions, indicating that the room-temperature tensile properties were affected by the DS microstructure.",0
"The limited glass forming ability (GFA) and deficient plasticity are two longstanding bottlenecks for the applications of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) as structural materials. In this article, we report a TiZr-based BMG with nominal composition of Ti36.2Zr30.3Cu8.3Fe4Be21.2 (at.%) which possesses exceptional GFA and remarkable compressive plasticity simultaneously. The alloy ingot in weight of 150g can be solidified into an amorphous state, indicating an exceptional GFA â the critical size for glass forming of the current BMG is estimated over 50mm. The plasticity of about 8% was obtained from the as-cast 2-mm-diameter rod with an aspect ratio of 2, concomitant obvious work hardening effect. The present BMG possessing exceptional GFA and remarkable compressive plasticity simultaneously may have a scientific importance on developing BMGs for structural applications.",0
"High purity Ga2O3, In2O3, and ZnO powders were weighted at a molar ratio of 1: 8: 1, and then InGaZnO (IGZO) ceramic target was fabricated by conventional solid state reaction method in air. IGZO thin films were subsequently prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method under different pressures at room temperature. The structural and physical properties of the as-grown films were diagnosed by various tools. It was confirmed that all the films exhibited amorphous structure. With the increase of oxygen pressure from 1.0Pa to 15.0Pa, surface roughness of IGZO films increased from 0.60nm to 1.82nm. The sample deposited under 10.0Pa oxygen partial pressure had a maximum carrier mobility of 28.6cm2/(VÂ·s), a minimum resistivity of 5.57Ã10â4 Î©cm, and a highest carrier concentration of 3.95Ã1020 cmâ3.",1
"The crystallization behavior of lithium disilicate glass powder heated in molten LiNO3 salt was investigated using X-ray diffraction techniques. Heat treatment at 500Â°C with LiNO3 molten salt caused a lithium metasilicate, Li2SiO3, crystal phase to appear after 5â96 h. By contrast, glass powder heat-treated in air at 500Â°C remained amorphous after 5 h and turned into lithium disilicate, Li2Si2O5, crystal after 40 h. Qualitatively similar results were obtained at 400Â°C. Glass powder heat-treated at 575Â°C in both molten salt and in air turned into lithium disilicate crystal. Metasilicate crystallization occurs with LiNO3 molten salt at 500 and 400Â°C due to the incorporation of lithium into the sample glass powder from the melt during crystallization. An increase in lithium content in the sample after molten salt heat treatment was confirmed by chemical analysis using dc plasma emission spectroscopy.",1
"A preliminary study has shown that bulk metallic glasses of the CuZrAl type of large dimension may be manufactured from amorphous powders densified by a process of sintering such as spark plasma sintering (SPS). However, to remedy the lack of plasticity of these materials, the addition of ductile crystalline particles was carried out in the present study. The zirconium was chosen because its properties are close to those of the amorphous matrix. The same sintering parameters as those optimized for the metallic glass are also applicable for the production of the composite for the different zirconium volume fractions retained, respectively 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. The materials obtained are dense. X-ray diffraction clearly indicates that only the amorphous matrix CuZrAl and the crystalline zirconium are present. Young's modulus as well as the elastic limit decrease only very slightly with the addition of crystalline particles. Decrease in hardness is more pronounced. On the other hand, the plastic deformation increases with the addition of zirconium, reaching about 4.9% for the alloy containing 50% zirconium. The analysis of the fracture surfaces clearly shows the role of the ductile crystalline particles, namely the deceleration of the shear bands. The influence of volume fraction and size of the crystalline particles and of matrix toughness is discussed from a mechanical point of view. Therefore, SPS is a solution to solve both the problem of size and low ductility of amorphous metal, since it is possible to control microstructure and so to control mechanical properties.",0
"The Ti44.5Ni44.5Nb9Co2 alloys with different cold rolling ratios were annealed at 650â¯Â°C to investigate the influence of cold rolling ratio on the microstructure and recovery properties. The change in cold rolling ratio remarkably affected the distribution of Î²-Nb phase and the density of dislocations and precipitates. The density of dislocations increased with the increase of cold rolling ratio, which facilitated preferential nucleation and growth of Ti2Co precipitates. Meanwhile, high density of dislocations and precipitates retarded the recovery and recrystallization process. Owing to the strengthening effect of dislocations and nanoscale precipitates, the 40% cold rolled Ti44.5Ni44.5Nb9Co2 alloy annealed at 650â¯Â°C after 16% pre-strain exhibited 25% enhancement in the total recovery strain and over 50% improvement for the recovery stress compared to the typical Ti-Ni-Nb alloys.",0
"Introduction La couverture vaccinale anti-grippe des soignants en France est mÃ©diocre. Le risque de grippe chez les patients hospitalisÃ©s (grippe nosocomiale) a Ã©tÃ© peu estimÃ© dans ce contexte. Lâobjectif de notre Ã©tude Ã©tait dâÃ©valuer le poids des grippes nosocomiales dans un centre hospitalo-universitaire (CHU), leurs caractÃ©ristiques, et leurs consÃ©quences. MatÃ©riels et mÃ©thodes Ãtude rÃ©trospective observationnelle de tous les cas de grippe documentÃ©e chez des patients hospitalisÃ©s dans un CHU, sur la saison 2017â2018, dont les symptÃ´mes sont apparus plus de 72h aprÃ¨s lâadmission. Les critÃ¨res dâinclusion Ã©taient les suivantsÂ : (i) documentation de la grippe par PCR sur un prÃ©lÃ¨vement respiratoire obtenu>48h aprÃ¨s lâadmissionÂ ; (ii) absence de fiÃ¨vre et de signe respiratoire aigu Ã©vocateur de grippe au cours des 72Â premiÃ¨res h dâhospitalisation. Les donnÃ©es ont Ã©tÃ© recueillies Ã partir des dossiers mÃ©dicaux sur un questionnaire standardisÃ©. RÃ©sultats De novembre 2017Â Ã avril 2018, 860Â patients ont prÃ©sentÃ© au moins un Ã©chantillon positif pour la grippe. Parmi eux, 204 (23,7Â %) ont Ã©tÃ© diagnostiquÃ©s sur un prÃ©lÃ¨vement effectuÃ©>48h aprÃ¨s lâadmission, et 57 (6,6Â % du total des grippes hospitalisÃ©es), rÃ©pondaient aux critÃ¨res de grippe nosocomiale (symptÃ´mes apparus>72h aprÃ¨s lâadmission). Le dÃ©lai mÃ©dian entre lâadmission et les premiers symptÃ´mes Ã©tait de 11jours (IQR 7â19,5), et le dÃ©lai diagnostique mÃ©dian de 29h (IQR 15,5â48). LâÃ¢ge mÃ©dian Ã©tait de 76Â ans (IQR 72,2â86,9Â ; extrÃ¨mes, 22Â jours-99Â ans), le sexe ratio Ã©quilibrÃ© (31Â hommes, 26Â femmes), et les principales comorbiditÃ©s Ã©taient le diabÃ¨te (n =12), une maladie chronique cardiaque (n =11), ou respiratoire (n =7). Vingt patients (35,1Â %), avaient reÃ§u une vaccination anti-grippale pour cette saison. Trente patients (52,6Â %) ont acquis la grippe dans un service de gÃ©riatrie et 39Â patients (68,4Â %) Ã©taient en chambre double au moment du diagnostic. Une transmission croisÃ©e est documentÃ©e dans 14Â cas. On retrouve une nette prÃ©dominance de grippe B dans les cas nosocomiauxÂ : 46/57 (80,7Â %), vs 359/803 (44,6Â %) dans les cas non nosocomiaux, p <0,001).

Conclusion Les grippes nosocomiales reprÃ©sentent une entitÃ© non rare, prÃ©dominant chez les sujets Ã¢gÃ©s, avec des consÃ©quences majeures. Dans cet Ã©tablissement, la grippe B Ã©tait nettement plus souvent impliquÃ©e dans les cas nosocomiaux, que dans les autres cas, ce qui suggÃ¨re un ou des foyers Ã©pidÃ©mique(s) et/ou une transmissibilitÃ© nosocomiale accrue de de la grippe B par rapport Ã la grippe A.",0
"Spin glass magnetic properties are found in a ceramic sample of YBa2(Cu0.75Fe0.25)3O7+y . These include a clear separation between the field cooled and zero field cooled magnetization vs temperature curves, a nonlinear M vs H magnetization curve, with hysteresis and a remanent moment, and a logarithmic time decay of the remanent moment. The freezing temperature of 36K is consistent with Mossbauer and neutron scattering experiments showing spin glass behavior in these materials. Finally an additional rather sharp magnetic transition is observed at 3.2 K.",0
"The metallic glass formability of aluminum-rich Alî¸Niî¸Feî¸Gd alloys has been systematically investigated. The critical cooling rate required to form an amorphous state in this system is generally low, and comparable to that of some of the best metallic glass formers, such as Pdî¸Cuî¸Si. Amorphous ribbons up to 0.25 mm thick can easily be produced by the single-roller melt-spinning technique. Tensile strengths as high as 1280 MPa and Young's modulus of 75 GPa have been obtained. Bulk amorphous alloys with good mechanical properties are optimized in Al85Ni6Fe3Gd6. DSC and DTA studies reveal that the glass formability is unique for Al-based alloys because the reduced glass temperature T rg for Alî¸Niî¸Feî¸Gd can be as low as 0.44. This is much lower than conventional theory would suggest for easy glass forming systems. A mechanism for the unusual glass formability is suggested.",0
"The fragility and glass transition for binary mixtures of 1,2-propanediol and LiBF4 were investigated by measuring the heating rate dependence of glass transition temperature (T g) using differential scanning calorimetry. With increasing LiBF4 mole fraction, x, up to 0.25, fragility, m, increased rapidly from 53 to 85, and then remained approximately unchanged for x >0.25. The concentration dependences of T g and heat capacity jump at T g also showed anomalies around x =0.25. We suggest this mixture transformed from a moderate to quite fragile liquid at x =0.25 because of a structural change from a hydrogen-bonding- to ionic-interaction-dominant system.",0
"Quasicrystalline phase with different volume fraction were formed by isothermally annealing the as-cast Zr62Al9.5Ni9.5Cu14Nb5 bulk metallic glass at 723K for different times. The effects of quasicrystals on the deformation behavior of the materials were studied by nanoindentation and compression test. It revealed that the alloys with homogeneous amorphous structure exhibit pronounced flow serrations during the nanoindentation loading, while no obvious flow serration is observed for the sample with quasicrystals more than 10vol.%. However, further compression tests confirm that the no-serrated flows are formed due to different reasons. For annealed samples containing quasicrystals less than 35vol.%, continuous plastic deformation occurs due to propagation of multiple shear bands. While the disappearance of serrated flow cannot be explained by the generation of multiple shear bands for samples containing quasicrystals more than 35vol.%, which will fracture with a totally different fracture mode, namely, dimple fracture mode under loading instead of shear fracture mode.",0
"The sloshing impact load of liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers is an important issue that can cause failure of the insulation system of LNG cargo containment systems, leading to cryogenic leakage from the hull of the ship and generation of boil-off gas. Thus, insulation systems should be designed by considering the repeated impact loading based on the design life as well as the cryogenic temperature. Polyurethane foam (PUF), epoxy resin, and plywood are acceptable materials that can be used to fabricate a typical insulation system to protect the load from the environment. In this study, we investigated the effect of adding hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) to the epoxy resin on the reinforcement of the insulation material. Specimens were fabricated using PUF, plywood, and an HGM/epoxy composite matrix with varying weight fractions of embedded HGM (0, 10, and 20Â wt.%). The sloshing impact loads were estimated by the statistical method of the Weibull model, and the top 2% level of the Weibull distribution was selected. The calculated sloshing impact load was 3Â J as calculated from the experimental results, and then repeated impact loadings under ambient (290Â K) and cryogenic temperature (110Â K) were realized in a drop tower facility. To obtain details of the dynamic behavior, microstructural analyses were performed using scanning electron microscopy (to detect the agglomeration of HGM embedded in the epoxy resin). Experimental results show that 10Â wt.% HGM showed the best performance in absorption and dynamic behavior. The 10Â wt.% HGM specimen also exhibited superior thermal conductivity.",0
"A novel Ni-free (Zr48Cu32Al8Ag8,Ta4)Si0.75 bulk metallic glass composite (BMG-C), showing an excellent combination of high strength and remarkable ductility, was laser spot welded with the pre-selected laser welding parameters. After welding, the microstructure evolution, glass forming ability (GFA) and mechanical properties of the welded samples were determined by a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the Vickers microhardness test. Test results showed that the parent material (PM), heat affected zone (HAZ) and weld fusion zone (WFZ) in the welds all consist of an amorphous matrix with two kinds of Ta particles: micro-sized and nano-sized. In the WFZ, during the rapid melting, the partial dissolution of micro-sized Ta particles resulted in the reduction of their volume fraction. After subsequent rapid cooling, partial micro-sized Ta particles were transformed to nano-sized particles or nano-sized particle accumulations. This transformation resulted in a slightly higher magnitude of hardness in the WFZ. Furthermore, it was found that the surrounding area of micro-sized Ta in the WFZ has better resistance to the etchant solution. In the HAZ, small amounts of Zr2Cu and nano-sized Ta tended to precipitate on the micro-sized Ta surface, and may act as heterogeneous nucleation sites. However, the small amount of precipitation in the HAZ and the micro-sized Ta transformation in the WFZ did not significantly affect the magnitude of the GFA indices, ÎT x, Î³ and Î³ m, when compared to that of un-welded BMG-C.",0
"Structural and spectral evaluations of Nd3+ and Nd3+/Yb3+ doped CdO-V2O5 glasses based on X-Ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, absorption, excitation and emission spectra and decay time profiles, are performed. X-Ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectroscopy revealed that all samples are amorphous (glassy phase) up to 4â¯mol% of Yb3+, without segregation of any crystalline phase. The optical band gap values determined from the absorption spectra, assuming direct optical band gap, were in the range of 2.13â2.07â¯eV, depending on the Yb3+ concentration. The emission spectra of the Nd3+ and Nd3+/Yb3+ doped glasses upon Nd3+ excitation at 585â¯nm, displayed the NIR Nd3+ feature emissions centered at 880, 1060 and 1342â¯nm, and Yb3+ emission at 977â¯nm, being the latter one achieved at expenses of energy transfer from Nd3+. According to the shortening of the Nd3+ emission decay profiles such process is not radiative with efficiency in the range of 0.181â0.521, depending on the Yb3+ content. The 880â¯nm Nd3+ decay fitting using the Inokuti-Hirayama model considering, energy migration among donors, suggested that an electric dipole-dipole interaction might mediate the energy transfer process, within Nd3+-Yb3+ clusters.",1
"High-speed transient currents are often observed in chalcogenige glasses. We explain these effects by invoking the presence of Valence Alternation Pairs (VAPs). After an electric field is applied across the chalcogenide glass, carriers can tunnel directly from the electrodes onto the appropriately charged defect centers. This leads to the appearance of potential barriers near the contacts, resulting in a rapid decay of the current. Such a mechanism cannot occur in materials without a large concentration of negatively correlated defects.",1
"Nanocrystalline LaF3 germanate glass ceramics were prepared and used as host for optically active Ho3+ ions. LaF3 crystallites precipitate by internal nucleation with sizes in the range of 7â17nm. During crystallization, Ho3+ is incorporated into the fluoride lattice on La3+ sites, leading to reduced probability of multiphonon relaxation and, hence, significantly enhanced emissions within 1300â1440 and 1400â1550nm wavelength range. Excited state absorption spectra, stimulated emission spectra and spectral gain coefficients of the (5S2, 5F4)â 5I5 transition indicate suitability of the material for E-band optical amplification.",1
"We fabricate a nanolaminate by repeated co-sputter deposition of a 60nm-thick Cu50Zr50 metallic glass layer alternating with transfer of graphene. In situ micro-tensile tests reveal that the addition of a very small fraction (0.46vol%) of graphene in the nanolaminate improve the elastic modulus and yield strength of the nanolaminate by 9.6% and 14%, respectively, comparing with those of the 360nm-thick monolithic Cu50Zr50 metallic glass. The nanolaminate also show enhanced tensile ductility: an ultimate tensile strength of 2.23GPa and fracture strain of 5.39% were attained by strain-hardening after yielding at 1.98GPa stress and 3.69% strain.",0
"Samples of glass fiber epoxy composites made with resin containing 0.5wt.% multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) have shown enhanced interlaminar shear strength relative to unmodified epoxy when evaluated using compression shear test. Improvement in the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the composites can be due to an increase in the matrix shear strength or an increase in the fiberâmatrix interface strength or both. In this work, we conducted tests to assess the relative contributions of the matrix shear properties and the glass fiberâepoxy interface to the ILSS enhancement. Samples of reinforced matrix were prepared by dispersing 0.5% MWNT by weight in epoxy. Both the reinforced resin and neat resin control samples were subjected to identical ultrasonic agitation. Shear properties of the neat epoxy film and the MWNT reinforced epoxy film were investigated using a shear punch tests on miniature specimens (6.4mm diameter, 0.5mm thick). The strength of the fiberâmatrix interface for both modified and unmodified matrix was also characterized using the microdroplet test. The results show that the change in ILSS is primarily due to the contribution from the strengthening of the fiber matrix interface and not from a change in the matrix shear strength.",0
"The effects of the alloying elements Zn on the mechanical properties, intergranular corrosion behavior and microstructure of AlâMg alloys have been examined. The type, morphology and distribution of the precipitates both at the grain boundary and in the matrix were systematically observed by optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Integrated intergranular corrosion test and transmission electron microscopy results indicated the stable ternary AlâMgâZn phase precipitated at grain boundary rather than AlâMg binary phase with Zn addition to AlâMg alloy, and discontinuously precipitated at the grain boundary. Also, the area fraction of AlâMgâZn phase at the grain boundary decreased with an increase in the Zn content. The intergranular corrosion resistance and strength of the alloy enhanced by Zn addition. In grains, the amount of AlâMgâZn phase and AlâMg increasing with Zn content increases. The AlâMg phase was found to be nucleation at preexisting AlâMn phase. Finally, detailed explanation for controlling and optimizing the microstructure in the Zn modified alloy was discussed.",0
"Two types of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites were fabricated viz., GFRP with neat epoxy matrix (GFRP-neat) and GFRP with hybrid modified epoxy matrix (GFRP-hybrid) containing 9wt.% of rubber microparticles and 10wt.% of silica nanoparticles. Fatigue tests were conducted on both the composites under WISPERX load sequence. The fatigue life of the GFRP-hybrid composite was about 4â5 times higher than that of GFRP-neat composite. The underlying mechanisms for improved fatigue performance are discussed. A reasonably good correlation was observed between the experimental fatigue life and the fatigue life predicted under spectrum loads.",0
"For several reasons germanate glasses, doped with manganese or chromium ions are expected to yield efficient red luminescence. We report the analysis of absorption, luminescence and decay measurements on doped and undoped glasses. The Mn2+ emission spectrum is red-shifted to 700 nm and energy transfer from the host glass extends the Mn2+ excitation spectrum. When these glasses are doped with Cr3+, high luminescence quantum efficiencies can be obtained, the upper limit being 25%.",1
"Glass fiber (GF) membrane is evaluated as a potential separator for lithiumâsulfur batteries. It is found that GF membrane has a highly porous structure with superior thermal stability, resulting in high liquid electrolyte uptake and enhanced electrochemical performance. LiâS cells using GF membrane as the separator can retain a capacity of 617mAhgâ1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2C, which is 42% higher than that of cells using commercial microporous polypropylene separator. During rate capability tests, the capacity of LiâS cells using GF membrane decreases slowly from the reversible capacity of 616mAhgâ1 at 0.2C to 505, 394 and 262mAhgâ1 at 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively. It should be noted that these cells can still deliver a high capacity of 587mAhgâ1 with a high retention of 95% when the current density is lowered back to 0.2C. The improved cycling and rate performance are ascribed to the fact that the highly porous GF membrane can increase the intake of soluble polysulfide intermediates and slow down their rapid diffusion to the Li anode side, which can not only improve the utilization of active material, but help protect the Li anode surface as well.",0
"Effect of cryogenic treatment (CT) on microstructure and mechanical properties of the Cu-based bulk metallic glasses matrix composite (Cu46Zr46Al8) was investigated. CT brought about the refinement of the primary CuZr phase, the formation of the martensite phase accompanying with the morphology modification of the CuZr precipitates, contributing to the improvement in the microhardness and the compression fracture strength. The size of the CuZr crystalline phase was reduced from about 3Î¼m to 2Î¼m and the morphology of the CuZr precipitate was transformed from the rotundity to the short rod-shape. The compression fracture strength and the microhardness of the as-cast Cu46Zr46Al8 composite were 1340MPa and 512Hv respectively, while they were 1759Mpa and 574Hv respectively after CT. Furthermore, CT accelerated the fracture morphology transformation from the ductile to the brittle. The possible mechanisms involved in microstructural modification and strength as well as microhardness improvement were discussed.",0
"High-energy ball milling was employed to induce plastic deformation of Zr70Cu20Ni10 metallic glass ribbons, resulting in intersected and branched shear bands with a minimal spacing of about 30nm. Crystallization was not observed in the shear bands. The free volume content in the deformed metallic glass increases with increasing duration of ball milling. Compared with the as-spun metallic glass, 28.8% more free volume is introduced in the metallic glass after ball milling for 80h.",0
"Mg65Cu25Re10 (Re=Y, Gd) and Mg64Cu25Nb1Re10 (Re=Y, Gd) bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have been fabricated by copper mould casting. It is shown that the minor addition of Nb can not only increase the thermal stability but also improve the fracture strength and the toughness of the Mg-based BMG alloys greatly. The fracture strength of Mg64Cu25Nb1Y10 and Mg64Cu25Nb1Gd10 reaches as high as 1023MPa and 973MPa, respectively. The Young's modulus has also been increased by the addition of Nb. From the fracture morphologies of the Nb bearing Mg-based BMG alloys, it is known that the size of plastic deformation zone can be increased to micrometer scale. This work proves that it is possible to improve the strength and toughness of Mg-based BMG by adding an element having positive heat of mixing with the constituent elements.",0
"Microhardness, wear properties and microstructure of Fe-based coatings with various WC contents on H13 hot-working die steel by laser cladding were investigated. Special attention was paid to the effects of various WC contents on the microstructural characterization and wear properties of different coatings by means of optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results indicated that only a small part of the periphery of the WC in the WC-added coatings was melted, and the un-melted WC particles in the coatings acted as a hard reinforcement. Besides, the microhardness in the cladding layer increased with the increment of the mass fraction of WC particles, and presented a gradient distribution along in-depth direction of the coatings. Furthermore, the Fe-based clad coating with WC particles exhibited a higher wear resistance and a lower friction coefficient compared with the substrate and Fe-based clad coating. In addition, the influence mechanism of WC particles on microstructural evolution and wear resistance was also discussed.",0
"This paper demonstrates a fish pathogen reduction procedure that uses TiO2 solâgel coating Fe3O4@TiO2 powder on glass substrate. Such procedure can effectively relieve two constraints that haunt TiO2 sterilization applications: 1) the need for UV for overcoming the wide band gap of pure TiO2 and 2) the difficulty of its recovering from water for reuse. In the process, visible light responsive Fe3O4/TiO2 nanoparticles are synthesized and immobilized on glass using TiO2 solâgel as the binder for fish bacterial pathogen disinfection test. After 3h of visible light irradiation, the immobilized Fe3O4@TiO2's inhibition efficiencies for fish bacterial pathogen are, respectively, 50% for Edwardsiella tarda (BCRC 10670) and 23% for Aeromonas hydrophila (BCRC 13018).",0
"A newly developed confining system for rectangular columns required a wrapping, which sustained a large amount of parasitic bending due to the curved shape of the laminates at the cross-section corners. To investigate the effect of parasitic bending on unidirectional carbon (CFRP) and glass fiber (GFRP) reinforced polymer laminates, 4 ply coupons were laminated with a semi-elastic hybrid resin and cured in a curved shape. During the tensile tests, the curved coupons stretched and failed after further loading. Due to the parasitic bending, occurring during stretching, the tensile resistance was reduced by 48% for the CFRP and by only 18% for the GFRP coupons. Tests with high-strength, high-modulus epoxy resin laminated GFRP coupons were drawn upon and compared with the semi-elastic hybrid resin laminated GFRP coupons. There is a beneficial effect on the tensile resistance with the use of semi-elastic hybrid resin.",0
"A series of first principle calculations were carried out to investigate thermodynamical, electronic and optical properties of cubic B x Al 1 â x N ordered alloys using supercell approach within density functional theory (DFT). Here we calculate the lattice constants using van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) at several concentrations (x) of boron. We find that the vdW-DF prediction shows slightly better agreement with experiment in contrast to local density approximation (LDA)/generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The results show that the direct energy band gap (Î v âÎ c ) has strong nonlinear dependence on the concentration (x). At x=0.04 and 0.84, B x Al 1 â x N has a phase transition from direct to an indirect band gap semiconductor. To describe the alloys' solubility, formation enthalpy were calculated and fitted to quadratic function to obtain interaction parameter. The calculated Tâx phase diagram shows a broad miscibility gap with a high critical temperature equal to 3063K. The calculated dielectric function is explained in terms of band structure and density of states and compared with the available experimental data, showing good agreement.",0
"A fully amorphous Zr65Al10Ni10Cu15 alloy was squeeze cast into a sheet, and its air-oxidation properties were investigated between 250 and 400Â Â°C. It displayed poorer oxidation resistance than the Zr metal, due mainly to oxidation of not only Zr but also Cu. The outer, loosely-adherent thin oxide layer consisted of Cu-rich oxides, while the inner, thick oxide layer consisted of Zr-rich oxides. The oxides formed were (Î±-, Î²-)ZrO2â x and CuO.",0
"Based on the quaternary Ti41Zr25Be29Al5 glassy alloy with a critical diameter of 7mm reported not long ago, an obvious enhancement of glass-forming ability (GFA) has been realized in this alloy by the addition of Cu element. A series of (Ti41Zr25Be29Al5)100âx Cu x (x=0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11at%) glassy alloys have been developed and some of them can be cast into one-centimeter diameter fully glassy rods by copper mold suction casting. It has been found that Cu addition could stabilize the liquid phase and suppress the crystallization, resulting in improvement of the GFA of the alloy. The addition of Cu also increases the compressive strength of the alloy and the (Ti41Zr25Be29Al5)91Cu9 glassy alloy possesses a specific strength (defined as yield strength/density) of 4.13Ã105 Nm/kg, which is much higher than most other reported centimeter-sized bulk metallic glasses. The present result suggests that the newly developed (Ti41Zr25Be29Al5)91Cu9 glassy alloy is a good candidate for structural applications because of its good glass-forming ability and mechanical properties.",0
"Two-layer laminates were developed by using glass fabric with plain weave as the reinforcement and unsaturated polyester the matrix. The fabrication was carried out with the vacuum assisted resin infusion method. Samples were immersed in distilled water for various period which included 7, 14 and 21 days. The environmental temperature during the water treatment was kept about 29Â°C. The interlaminar behaviour of the treated samples was tested by using an instrument designed for fusible interlining pilling intensity evaluation in the fashion field. By separating the fabricated two-layer composite, the resulted peeling intensity may be regarded as a representative of the interlaminar bonding strength. Significant improvement of the peel bond strength after the water immersion suggests that water environment improve the bonding strength between the layers. This is attributed to the function of the water molecules penetrated into the composites.",0
"Non-woven materials feature unique properties that allow them to be used in different applications. In this study, polypropylene and glass fibers were commingled and pressed to obtain partially compacted composites. Fiber content, fiber length and processing parameters were modified to investigate their influence on the final properties of the composites. These were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tensile and porosity measurements as well as fiber content and length distribution analysis. The stiffness of the composites increase linearly with increasing glass fiber content, from 1.6 GPa to 4.8 GPa. Longer fibers can be found in the composites with higher fiber contents. Applied pressure and number of stacked layers were found significant factors for the limitation of void content. Fiber-matrix interactions were improved with the addition of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene, increasing the tensile properties in the low porosity range. A suitable model was found for the prediction of mechanical properties.",0
"As a promising color converter in warm white LEDs, phosphors-in-glass (PiG) thick film is still suffering from the deficiency of high-efficient red phosphors. Herein, commercial Ce3+:Y3Al5O12 and/or Eu2+:Sr2Si5N8 phosphors were successfully embedded into a phosphate glass matrix coated on a soda-lime-silicate glass substrate. Their structural and luminescent properties were respectively investigated by XRD, SEM and photoluminescence spectra analysis. Color-tunable emission was achieved by varying the weight ratio of red to yellow phosphors. After fabricating LED devices with the optimal sample, considerable luminous performance was achieved with luminous efficacy of 72.1â¯lm/W, correlated color temperature of 5612â¯K and color rendering index Ra of 82.5. It suggested that the Ce3+:Y3Al5O12/Eu2+:Sr2Si5N8 PiG thick film exhibits a significant potential for high-power warm white LEDs.",1
"This study investigates the properties of self-compacting glass concrete (SCGC), where liquid crystal glass sand (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) is used in place of aggregates. The results indicate that the slump flow of self-compacting glass concrete (SCGC) increases with higher glass sand content. Additionally, replacing 20% of the aggregates yields the highest compressive and flexural strengths. Self-compacting glass concrete has the highest ultrasonic pulse velocity. After 56days, the electric resistivity is higher than 20kÎ©cm. Finally, when the volume of glass is increased to 30%, the amount of chloride ion penetration is reduced and the durability of the self-compacting glass concrete is improved.",0
Electronic wavefunctions of Tm3+ in intermediate coupling were obtained and used to calculate the U (Î») matrix elements between all possible states of the 4f12 configuration. The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters Î©Î» obtained for Tm3+ in phosphate and tellurite glasses were used in conjunction with the U (Î»)'s to calculate the forced electric dipole line strengths. The total electric and magnetic transition probabilities are calculated. The entire theoretical spectrum involving the ground and excited levels (from 129 nm to 16447 nm) is given.,1
Energies and wavefunctions of doubly ionized states of HF and Ne have been calculated with a general ab-initio CI program. Excellent agreement with the experimental Auger spectra is obtained by including configuration interaction on previously calculated Auger transition rates. Configuration mixing is shown to be crucial for the low-energy transitions in the Auger spectra and has a more pronounced effect in HF than in Ne. This can be attributed to interaction between Auger diagram states and low lying correlation states. This molecular effect also explains the broadening of the spectral lines in HF relative to Ne.,0
"Fe-based metallic glass forming powders have been deposited on mild steel substrates using high power laser cladding. Coatings microstructures have been analysed by scanning- and transmission-electron microscopy and at varying substrate dilutions, have been found to comprise a 100 to 500Â nm interdendritic austenitic phase and a dendritic dual-phase of ferrite/martensite. The application of double layer coatings has shown microstructural refinement. This leads to a needle-like microstructure resulting in a nanoindentation tested hardness increase from ~11Â GPa up to almost 15Â GPa. The layers have been subjected to both dry sliding wear and 3-body microscale abrasive wear testing. The dry sliding results show the layers to exhibit excellent wear resistance â particularly at high speed (50Â cm sâ1) with wear rate values of ~1Ã10â8Â mm3/Nm being recorded for the double layer coatings. The single layer coatings reveal a micro-wear mechanism connected with the slip between the ferrite and martensite in the dendritic dual-phase. Microscale abrasive wear testing also reveals that the layers have a good wear resistance, with wear scars exhibiting characteristic material removal by micro-chipping. There is no preferential abrasion of any one phase, nor are track over-lap areas, cracks or pores found to result in varying wear scar dimensions.",0
"Introduction La transition des soins chez les jeunes diabÃ©tiques de type 1 (DT1) Ã la pÃ©riode critique de lâadolescence comporte des enjeux mÃ©dicaux majeurs. Patients et MÃ©thodes Les risques de rupture de suivi et de complications ont Ã©tÃ© Ã©valuÃ©s longitudinalement dans une Ã©tude multicentrique en Ile de France (6 centres de pÃ©diatrie et 9 centres de diabÃ©tologie pour adultes). Des auto-questionnaires ont Ã©tÃ© remplis par les patients et un questionnaire par leurs mÃ©decins Ã la derniÃ¨re visite en pÃ©diatrie (T1), puis en diabÃ©tologie pour adultes 0,5-2 ans aprÃ¨s (T2). RÃ©sultats 61 patients (60 % du taux rÃ©gional) Ã¢gÃ©s de 18,6 ans DT1 depuis 8,8 ans, ont Ã©tÃ© inclus Ã T1. Les donnÃ©es ont Ã©tÃ© recueillies Ã T2 chez 57 patients (93 %), en moyenne 1 an aprÃ¨s T1. Le taux moyen dâHbA1c ne diffÃ¨re pas entre T2 et T1 (9 Â± 2,2 % vs 8,9 Â± 1,8 %), malgrÃ© lâaugmentation du nombre dâinjections (3,7 vs 3,3 inj/jour). Le nombre dâacidocÃ©toses/an tend Ã Ãªtre plus Ã©levÃ© Ã T2 quâÃ T1 (p = 0,06). 6 patients ont dÃ©veloppÃ© une rÃ©tinopathie minime (RD) Ã T2 (HbA1c = 9,7 Â± 1,2 %, durÃ©e du DT1 = 11,2 Â± 3,9 ans). Par comparaison avec les patients sans RD, ils sont significativement plus Ã¢gÃ©s (20,2 vs 19,4 ans, p = 0,05) et ont un IMC plus Ã©levÃ© (25,7 vs 22,6, p = 0,025).

Conclusion Cette Ã©tude montre les risques de la transition des soins chez les adolescents DT1 malgrÃ© une organisation de cette transition. Le mauvais contrÃ´le glycÃ©mique, lâapparition de complications, et le taux Ã©levÃ© de ruptures de suivi font insister sur la nÃ©cessitÃ© de dÃ©velopper 1) des soins et des stratÃ©gies spÃ©cifiques, 2) une supervision Ã©troite des patients au moment de la transition et dans les 2 annÃ©es aprÃ¨s, par une collaboration active entre pÃ©diatres et diabÃ©tologues pour adultes, 3) lâidentification de patients Ã haut risque de rupture de suivi lors de la transition.",0
Spectroscopic properties of Ho3+ doped tellurite glass (1 mol.% of Ho3+) have been studied. The absorption and fluorescence spectra have been recorded and analysed using the JuddâOffelt theory. The analysis indicates that Ho doped tellurite glasses can show lasing on the 5F4 (5S2)â5I8 transition (548.0 nm).,1
"The aim of this work to investigate the effect of glass fiber (GF) on the thermal properties of sugar palm (SP)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) hybrid composites. Sugar palm/glass fiber hybrid composites at the different weight fraction of 0/40, 10/30, 20/20 and 30/10 were prepared by using melt-mixing compounding followed by hot pressing machine. Thermal properties of hybrid composites carried out by using Dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA). The storage modulus (Eâ²), loss modulus (Eâ³) and damping factor (tan Î´) were evaluated as a function of different relative sugar palm/glass fiber weight fraction. Also, the peak height was investigated for tan Î´ curves. At higher glass fiber loading exhibited the highest storage and loss modulus while the lowest damping factor was observed for higher sugar palm fiber loading. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that the amount of residue decreased as the glass fiber loading decreased. Overall, the hybridization of glass fiber with sugar palm/TPU composites enhances the thermal properties of the hybrid composites for automotive applications.",0
"Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is mainly carried by membrane type LNG ships, whose cargo containment system is composed of dual tightness barriers and two insulation boards. The insulation board should have not only cryogenic reliability against thermal load, but also high thermal insulation performance for safe and efficient transportation of LNG. Although polyurethane foam (PUF) has been widely used for the insulation board due to its low production cost and relatively good thermal and mechanical properties, the cryogenic reliability of PUF is a remaining concern in marine fields due to its brittleness at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, the PUF was reinforced with chopped E-glass fiber because of its good dispersion and distribution characteristics. The compression, tension and the fracture toughness test were conducted with respect to the amount of the chopped E-glass fiber both at the room (25Â°C) and cryogenic (â150Â°C) temperatures. From the experimental results, it was found that the chopped E-glass fiber reinforcement increased the fracture toughness of the PUF much, especially at the cryogenic temperature. Therefore, the PUF reinforced with chopped glass fibers will improve much the reliability of the LNG cryogenic containment system during the voyage of LNG ships.",0
"The influence of co-dopant Na2O on the thermoluminescence (TL) properties and kinetic parameters of Cu2O doped Calcium Lithium borate glass (CLB:Cu) are comprehensively examined and studied in this paper. The glasses were prepared by melt quenching method upon adding various Na2O concentrations of 0.1% to 1â¯mol%, and irradiated with 60CO gamma-ray, 6â¯MeV electron and 6â¯MV X-ray photon. The glow curve exhibits a prominent peak (TM) at 188â¯Â°C. The TL intensity and sensitivity was enhanced by a factor of 2 and 1.7 respectively due to the incorporation of Na2O, and this was attributed to the creation of extra electron traps mediated by radiative recombination energy transfer. We achieved good linearity of the TL yield with dose low fading, excellent reproducibility and a promising effective atomic number (Zeff = 8.85), all of which are highly suitable for dosimetry. The effects of sunlight on the TL are also tested and investigated. These attractive features demonstrate that our dosimeter is useful in personal, environmental and medical radiation therapy application.",1
"In this work, surface modification of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 bulk metallic glass for improving the mechanical properties was carried out by employing laser surface melting (LSM) treatment. The structures and thermal properties of the as-cast and LSM treated samples were characterized with high energy synchrotron diffraction and differential scanning calorimeter, respectively. After the laser surface remelting, the Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 alloy still consisted of fully amorphous structure. In comparison to the as-cast Zr-based alloy without distinct plasticity, the LSM treated one exhibited compressive plastic strain of 5.3% prior to fracture. The improvement in mechanical behavior of the LSM treated metallic glass may be resulted from complex residual stress distributions and increase in free volume in the surface layer induced by LSM treatment.",0
"In this work, alumina nanoparticles at various concentrations were used to modify the epoxy system to develop the composites along with unidirectional (UD) glass-fibers. In order to understand the influence of alumina nanoparticles over the directional compressive properties, tests were performed along longitudinal and transverse directions of the laminate using a universal testing machine. To generate the base line data the laminates with the unmodified matrix are also tested. The maximum enhancement of compressive properties were seen in the composite having 1.0wt% of alumina nanoparticles. The compressive modulus and compressive strength was found to be 17.76% and 19.43% in the transverse direction where as it found to be 2.89% and 3.44% in the longitudinal direction respectively. Results of the present study showed that glass-fiber reinforced nano-modified polymers (GFRP) exhibit significantly improved compressive properties such as compressive strength and compressive modulus along the transverse direction while the properties along the longitudinal direction were not affected much by the nano-fillers, due to the dominating effect of the fiber-reinforcement. The graphs and figures are employed to explain the results.",0
"Novel (Zr0.46Cu0.46Al0.08)100âxSnx bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) were prepared by copper mold casting. The microstructure, thermal stability and mechanical properties of the BMGs were investigated. The results reveal that the thermal stability of the BMGs trends to decrease with the Sn content. The plasticity and the fracture strength are however found to be enhanced with the Sn addition. Notably with an appropriate amount of Sn addition, nano-scale phase separation with the formation of CuâAl-rich and ZrâSn-rich glassy phases takes place during solidification, which improves the mechanical properties of the alloys effectively.",0
"Composite laminates, made of glass/epoxy using compression molding technique, were subjected to impact loading. The ballistic limit and energy absorption capacity of the laminates were obtained. Experiments were carried out to study the effect of fiber orientation and thicknesses on ballistic limit and energy absorption of the laminates, by using a rigid conical bullet having 9.5mm diameter and mass of 7.5g in an air gun. Analytical expressions were obtained to find the ballistic limit, residual velocity and energy absorption capacity of the laminates. The expressions obtained by considering the various damage modes, which were involved in penetration, when laminates subjected to impact loading. The values obtained from analysis were compared with experimental results and good agreement was found. The strain rate sensitivity of the glass/epoxy composites was considered for analysis.",0
"Fe-base bulk metallic glasses in the alloy system FeâCâSiâBâPâCrâMoâAl have been developed using hot metal and industrial ferro-alloys. The amorphous alloys can be cast into fully amorphous rods with diameters of up to 4mm, demonstrating high glass-forming ability and high strength (>3GPa). Thermal stability and crystallization behavior of the FeâCâSiâBâPâCrâMoâAl bulk metallic glasses are also investigated. The Fe-base bulk metallic glasses can be produced cost-effectively and massively for extensive structural applications.",0
"In this study, hybrid multi-scale composites were developed from glass microfiber fabrics (GFs) and nano-epoxy resins containing electrospun glass nanofibers (EGNFs). The hypothesis was that, through dispersing a small amount of EGNFs into epoxy resin, mechanical properties (particularly out-of-plane mechanical properties) of the resulting hybrid multi-scale composites would be significantly improved. The composites were fabricated by the technique of vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM). The interlaminar shear strength, flexural properties, impact absorption energy, and tensile properties of the composites were evaluated, and the results were compared to those acquired from GFs/epoxy composite as well as GFs/epoxy composites containing chopped glass microfibers (GMFs); additionally, the reinforcement and/or toughening mechanisms were investigated. The study revealed that the nano-epoxy resin with 0.25wt.% of EGNFs resulted in substantial improvements on mechanical properties of the resulting hybrid multi-scale composites.",0
Pb-Xe and In-Ar mixtures at low temperatures are shown experimentally to undergo metal-non-metal transitions at about 60 and 33 at.% respectively of the metallic component. This observation is commented on in relation to metal-rare gas mixtures generally.,0

"A bulk metallic glass of Ti50Cu25Ni20Sn5 nominal composition was produced via a powder metallurgical route, namely the preparation of glassy powders by mechanical alloying followed by their consolidation by spark-plasma sintering. Samples were characterized with respect to their structure and thermal properties before and after sintering. A bulk glassy sample, having nearly full density and containing only a small fraction of the intermetallic NiTi2 phase, could be obtained after careful selection of sintering parameters.",0
"This paper presents the characterization of single-mode waveguides for 980 and 1550Â nm wavelengths. High quality planar waveguide structure was fabricated from Y1â x Er x Al3(BO3)4 multilayer thin films with x =0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5, prepared through the polymeric precursor and sol-gel methods using spin-coating. The propagation losses of the planar waveguides varying from 0.63 to 0.88Â dB/cm were measured at 632.8 and 1550Â nm. The photoluminescence spectra and radiative lifetimes of the Er3+ 4I13/2 energy level were measured in waveguiding geometry. For most samples the photoluminescence decay was single exponential with lifetimes in between 640Â Î¼s and 200Â Î¼s, depending on the erbium concentration and synthesis method. These results indicate that Er doped YAl3(BO3)4 compounds are promising for low loss waveguides.",0
"Graphene and/or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) films have widespread applications in many fields, due to their extraordinary physical and chemical properties. Several physical and chemical methods for preparing graphene and RGO films have been reported, but a facile and efficient method is still lacking. Here, we report a facile and effective electrochemical method to prepare RGO films from a GO aqueous solution. By applying a low direct current voltage (several volts) to an electrolytic cell made with two indium tin oxide (ITO) glass plates for a short time (in seconds), GO nanosheets close to the cathodal ITO glass surface are reduced and directly deposited on the surface to form RGO films, which show metallic luster and semi-transparency. The thickness and transmittance of the RGO films can be adjusted by changing reduction time and applied voltage. Moreover, patterned RGO films could be obtained by using patterned ITO glass plates. Very impressively, large-sized RGO films can be prepared on a large-sized ITO glass plate, and they can be peeled off by using an adhesive tape. The facile preparation of RGO films with controllable thickness, transmittance, pattern and size would facilitate their practical applications.",0
"The spin-flop or metamagnetic transition in antiferromagnetic rare earth (RE) superconductors may lead to the appearance of a magnetic domain structure with modulated vortex density. Near the vortex core a ferrimagnetic region could be formed and under appropriate conditions peculiar two-quanta vortices may be stable. The anisotropy of the magnetic RE subsystem substantially influences the intervortex interaction: in the RE superconductors with an easy axis magnetic anisotropy the flux lines attract each other at large distances if they are inclined with respect to the anisotropy axis. In this case the tilted lower critical field corresponds to the penetration of a vortex chain into the sample, rather than a single vortex.",0
"The glass-transition temperature (Tg ) and crystallization temperature (T Cr) have been determined for the system (60â x)V2O5âxSb2O3â40TeO2 with 0< x <10 (in mol%) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at heating rates Ï =3, 6, 9 and 13K/min. The effect of the heating rate and the Sb2O3 content on Tg is discussed. It was observed that the transition region shifts to higher temperatures when the measuring time is reduced (or, conversely, when the applied temperature rate is increased). Using differential scanning calorimetry, the compositional dependence of Tg has been determined and so, an empirical equation has been deduced which relates the glass-transition temperature with the Sb2O3 content.",1
A.c. mechanism of polaronic hopping in vanadium and iron phosphate glasses is discussed in the light of polaron tunnelling model. The polaron parameters calculated from this model appear reasonable and are in agreement with values obtained from analyses of d.c. conductivity data.,1
"This work describes a statistical design of experiments (DoE) testing campaign on 396 samples to evaluate the effect of replacing quartz aggregate in concrete with waste glass, and Portland cement with metakaolin to develop a novel generation of sustainable concrete tiles. The properties assessed were bulk density, permeability, dynamic modulus and length changes due to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) expansion. Metakaolin (MK) was used to replace Portland cement (PC) to verify the possibility of obtaining lower ASR expansion. Higher permeability and lower bulk density were obtained when the quartz was replaced with glass particles. The statistical analysis also confirmed that the dispersion of 15wt% of MK was able to mitigate any possible ASR expansion caused by the presence of coarse glass particles. The composite mixes evaluated in this work constitute promising materials to be used in concrete tiles or similar semi-dry compacted products.",0
"Terbium (Tb3+) doped oxyfluoro-titania-phosphate glasses of chemical composition (in mol%), (60 - x) P2O5 â 15 BaF2 â 20 CaF2 â 5 TiO2 â x Tb4O7, xâ¯=â¯0.05, 0.1 and 0.1 were fabricated by usual melt-quenching technique. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of the samples have been investigated by excitation, emission and decay profiles. Upon excitation at 377â¯nm, the PL spectra exhibit an intense band at 541â¯nm which corresponds to the 5D4 â 7F5 transition. The intensity ratio of green-to-blue (IG/IB) was found to be 9.2 for 0.1â¯mol% of Tb3+-doped glass. High-energy absorption bands were not resolved in the absorption spectrum but disclosed in the photoluminescence excitation spectrum. Decay curves were unveiled non-exponential and mono-exponential behaviours for the 5D3 and 5D4 levels, respectively. Lifetime of the 5D3 and 5D4 levels was decreased up to 0.1â¯mol%, and thereafter it was increased with the increase of Tb3+ ion concentration upon 377â¯nm excitation. The CIE chromaticity coordinates were supported that the green emission was predominant in Tb3+-doped oxyfluoro-titania-phosphate glasses.",1
"The results presented here are on the photoluminescence properties of different concentrations of Eu3+ in a 0.5 mol% Dy3+ doped zinc-aluminium-sodium-phosphate (ZANP) glasses. Under UV-light excitation the 0.5 mol% ZANP glass show a yellowish white light emission and in order to obtain white light emission, the Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZANP glasses with fixed Dy3+ concentration (0.5Â mol%) and varied Eu3+ concentration (0.1â1.5Â mol%) were synthesized. The energy transfer phenomenon between Dy3+ and Eu3+ ions was studied based from the emission spectra with different excitation wavelengths and the decay curves of the 4F9/2 level of Dy3+ ion. The energy transfer efficiency (É³) and energy transfer probabilities (Pda) are calculated for Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZANP glasses. The energy transfer probabilities are linear with the acceptor (Eu3+) concentration confirming the fact that the dipoleâdipole interaction is responsible for the energy transfer (ET) process of Dy3+âEu3+ ion. The chromaticity co-ordinates were calculated from emission spectra of Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZANP glasses with different excitation wavelengths. These results show that the white light has been achieved by exciting Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZANP glass with ultraviolet or blue light.",1
"The Glauber dynamics of an Ising spin glass with infinite-range interactions and additional static field, h, is investigated near the freezing temperature, Tf. We obtain critical slowing down at and below the de Almeida-Thouless instability line, hc(T), to order (1âT/Tf)3 with algebraic decay of the spin correlations â¼tâÎ½, where Î½= 1 2 at Tf and Î½â¤ 1 2 for T<T f .",0
"Borogermanate glasses show promise as scintillators due to their ability to incorporate high levels of heavy metal oxides without excessive loss of luminescent output intensity. Heavy metal oxide scintillating glasses of 50GeO2-25B2O3-(25-x)La2O3/Gd2O3-xTb2O3 (xÂ =Â 1,2,3,4) with the same stoichiometric composition of crystalline Tb doped LaBGeO5/GdBGeO5 were synthesized via the melt-quench method. Three times of higher light output under gamma ray excitation was observed from Tb doped GdBGeO5 based glass compared to LaBGeO5 glass due to efficient energy transfer between Gd-Tb pairs and higher luminescence efficiency in the GdBGeO5 glasses. The potential to form LaBGeO5/GdBGeO5 glass ceramic scintillators was also discussed and preliminarily investigated.",1
"RÃ©sumÃ© Le syndrome de platypnÃ©e-orthodÃ©oxie est une maladie rare caractÃ©risÃ©e par une dyspnÃ©e et une dÃ©saturation en oxygÃ¨ne dans la position verticale avec une amÃ©lioration dans la position couchÃ©e.

We report a case of an 87-year-old woman with a recent history of traumatic hip, spine deformity and vertebral compression fracture, referred due to dyspnea oxygen desaturation. Thoracic tomodensitometry excluded the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Transthoracic echocardiography, with intravenous administration of agitated saline contrast solution, revealed the presence of atrial septal defect associated with a right to left shunting and mild enlargement of aortic root. Surgical closure of atrial septal defect resulted in resolution of the syndrome.",0
"Structure and dynamics of binary SiO2, GeSe2, and ternary Ag/Ge/Se chalcogenide glasses are studied using the molecular dynamics (MD) method. Effective potentials consisting of two-body(steric repulsion, Coulomb interactions due to charge transfer, and charge-dipole interaction due to large electronic polarizability of anions) and three-body covalent interactions are proposed for chalcogenide glasses. Using these, MD simulations are performed to study short range order, intermediate range order manifested as the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP), the vibrational density of states, and the participation ratios. MD results are compared with X-ray and neutron experiments.",1
"All the properties of glass-ceramics are strongly dependent upon their nano or microstructure, including the percentage, composition and, structure of the residual glass phase. Unfortunately, however, determining the chemical composition of residual glass is far from trivial and there are very few publications on this matter. In this paper, we used electrical conductivity measurements by impedance spectroscopy to infer the composition of the residual glass in partially crystallized Li2SiO3-CaSiO3 glasses. The glass-ceramics were obtained by heat-treatment at 560â¯Â°C for distinct periods, in conditions where only lithium-metasilicate (Li2SiO3) crystallized. Consequently, residual glasses of the resulting glass-ceramics became depleted in lithium, and their ionic conductivity and the respective activation energies changed accordingly. Therefore, we obtained the compositions of residual glasses by comparing the glass-ceramics ionic conductivities and activation energies with those of reference glasses having known chemical composition. We validated these two methods by comparing the obtained residual glass compositions with those obtained using a technique that relates the glass transition temperatures of reference glasses with those of glass-ceramics. These novel methods employing ionic conductivity and activation energy yield similar results to those obtained using the glass transition temperature method. However, the electrical property techniques are non-destructive and can be used to follow the crystallization process in situ.",1
"Blue up-conversion luminescence properties in Tm3+-doped lead chloride tellurite glasses have been studied under 980nm excitation. The intense blue and relatively weak red emissions centered at 476 and 649nm corresponding to the transitions 1 G 4â3 H 6 and 1 G 4â3 H 4 of Tm3+, respectively, are simultaneously observed at room temperature. The effect of PbCl2 on up-conversion intensity is observed and discussed, and possible up-conversion mechanisms are evaluated. The intense blue up-conversion luminescence of Tm3+-doped lead chloride tellurite glasses may be a potentially useful material for developing up-conversion optical devices.",1
"Introduction Les mastocytoses cutanÃ©es sont liÃ©es Ã lâaccumulation et la prolifÃ©ration de mastocytes dans la peau, due Ã la mutation du proto-oncogÃ¨ne c-kit. Les principales formes cliniques rapportÃ©es sont lâurticaire pigmentaire, les formes papulonodulaires, le mastocytome et la forme cutanÃ©e diffuse.

"Niobium boride powders were synthesized by solid state reaction between niobium metal powder and amorphous boron powder. The formation of niobium borides was found to be dependent on temperature. Single phases of the stable borides, NbB and NbB2, were formed by heating mixed powders corresponding to the stoichiometric compositions at 1000 Â°C for 60 min. A single phase of Nb3B4 was obtained at a higher temperature of 1800 Â°C as a result of the promoted diffusion of boron atoms in niobium metal. All synthesized powders were well dispersed and had particle sizes of 5â10 Î¼m. The sinterability of the synthesized NbB2 powder was evaluated at high pressure (4 GPa) and temperature (1600 Â°C) for 15 min; a single-phase sintered compact of NbB2 was formed with a relative density of 98% and a Vickers microhardness of 2600 kg mmâ2.",1
"The effects of La on the glass-forming ability (GFA) of a Sm-based alloy were investigated. By partial substitution of Sm with La in (Sm0.62Al0.14Ni0.12Cu0.12)97Fe3 (at.%) alloy, of which the critical diameter for glass formation is 3mm, (Sm0.32La0.3Al0.14Ni0.12Cu0.12)97Fe3 glassy rods with a diameter up to 10mm can be fabricated by copper mold casting. The configuration entropy and critical cooling rate of the SmâLaâAlâNiâCuâFe alloy were calculated. It is indicated that the configuration entropy is increased and the critical cooling rate is decreased with the addition of La, implying that the La-containing alloys exhibit higher GFA than that of the La-free SmâAlâNiâCuâFe alloy. Moreover, with the addition of La, the Sm-based alloys exhibit reduced Gibbs free energy between the liquid phase and the crystalline phase in the supercooled liquid region and stronger liquid behavior, which are also beneficial to the enhanced GFA of the SmâLaâAlâNiâCuâFe alloys.",0
"A proton-conducting glass membrane based on porous phosphosilicate and perfluorosulfonic acid polymer was prepared via a modified solâgel approach.

"Er3+-doped alkaline earth titanium phosphate (RTP) glasses with molar composition of 24 (NaPO3)6 +30 KH2PO4 +25 TiO2 +20 RCl2 +1 Er2O3 were prepared by melt quenching technique. JuddâOfelt intensity parameters (Î© 2,4,6) were determined from the experimental oscillator strengths (f exp) of absorption bands. From these parameters spontaneous emission probabilities (A R), luminescence branching ratios (Î² R) and radiative lifetimes (Ï R) have been calculated. Visible and near infrared photoluminescence spectra has been recorded by exciting the samples at 380 and 970nm respectively. An intense broad emission band at 1.53Î¼m was observed corresponding to 4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transition. McCumber theory has been applied to determine the emission cross-sections (Ï e) of the 4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transition using the absorption cross-sections (Ï a). The lifetimes of 4S3/2 level were measured for the glasses by exciting the samples at 540nm wavelength and the quantum efficiencies were also determined.",1
We summarize the results of neutron diffraction studies done on fairly large number of MT2X2 compounds.

"The corrosion behaviour of both crystalline and largely amorphous forms of the Fe-based glass forming alloy, Fe43Cr16Mo16C15B10 alloy was investigated. Two different methods were used to induce transformation to the amorphous form of the alloy: laser melting and HVOF spraying. Both methods produced largely amorphous material, however the high brittleness of the alloy makes it susceptible to cracking during laser treatment, hence this technique is not suitable for large-scale application. Potentiodynamic scanning showed that in 0.5M H2SO4 and 3.5% NaCl electrolytes both amorphous forms of the alloy had better corrosion resistance (lower current densities for â200 to +1000mV SCE) compared to the crystalline material. The laser treated material and HVOF coating performed similarly in 3.5% NaCl. In 0.5M H2SO4 the HVOF coating had a lower current density than the laser melted material for almost all of the potential range â300 to +1000mV SCE. The improved corrosion behaviour of the largely amorphous material is attributed to its homogeneity, and particularly to the elimination of the Mo-rich phase that underwent preferential corrosion in the crystalline form of the material.",1
"The improvement of mechanical properties of HA with reinforcement of 5 and 10 wt.% bioglass (45S5) for different sintering temperatures was studied. Naturally produced HA from human teeth is sintered with the addition of 5 wt.% and 10 wt.% bioglass at 1200 and 1300Â Â°C for 4 h. The microhardness measurements, density and compression tests were performed and microstructural characterizations were carried out by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis in order to find the optimum sintering temperature. Finally average hardness value of 383Â±60 HV, average density of 2.72Â±0.01 g/cm3, and compressive strength value of Ï avr=83.03Â±33 MPa were achieved by sintering at 1200Â Â°C with the addition of 10 wt.% bioglass in HA. This effect can be attributed to formation of Ca5(PO4)2SiO4 based phases whereas increasing the sintering temperature also resulted in formation of Na2HPO4 7H2O phases which is responsible for decreasing mechanical properties.",1
The paper presents the thermoluminescence (TL) response of strontium tetraborate glass subjected to electron irradiations at various Dy2O3 concentrations ranging from 0.00 to 1.00mol%. All glass samples exhibited single broad peak with maximum peak temperature positioned at 170â215Â°C. The optimum TL response was found at Dy2O3 concentration 0.75mol%. This glass showed good linearity and higher sensitivity for 7MeV compared to 6MeV electrons. Analysis of kinetic parameters showed that the glasses demonstrate second order kinetic.,1
"Surface nanocrystallization of 1Cr18Ni9Ti austenite stainless steel was conducted by the supersonic fine particles bombarding (SFPB) technique. The friction coefficients and wear losses in air and vacuum were tested to analyse the effect of surface nanocrystallization on the tribological properties of 1Cr18Ni9Ti steel. The results show that the microstructure of the surface layer was refined into nano-grains successfully by SFPB treatment; furthermore, strain-induced martensitic transformation occurred during the treatment. The tribological properties of SFPB treated samples enhanced greatly, The dominant wear mechanism of the original 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel is abrasive wear and adhesive wear, while it transfers to the combined action of fatigue wear, abrasive wear and adhesive wear after surface nanocrystallization by SFPB.",0
"It has been shown recently, that Bi-doped glass optical fibers are a very promising active laser medium. Luminescence of Bi-doped glasses takes place in a spectral region of 1150â1500nm, where no efficient fiber lasers (or any other efficient lasers) exist. The glasses have very broad luminescence bands (200â400nm) and long lifetime (200â700Î¼s). The Bi absorption bands are situated in a spectral region of 500â1100nm where long-lived high-brightness laser diodes developed for the pumping of lasers and amplifiers are available. Besides, strong luminescence has been observed in a variety of glass compositions. In this paper the recent results on the new laser material â Bi-doped glasses and optical fibers are reviewed. First, luminescence properties of various Bi-doped glasses are discussed. Then we describe the Bi-doped silica-based optical fiber fabrication and the absorption and luminescence properties of the fibers. At last some results on Bi-doped fiber lasers and their applications are presented.",1
"The role of the addition of niobium oxide in large amount on the Er3+ emission properties at 1535nm for excitation at 980nm in borophosphate glass has been investigated. An increase of the emission, associated with a decrease of the lifetime of the 4I13/2 erbium level and a larger absorption cross section of erbium and ytterbium at 980nm was evidenced. Changes induced on hydroxyl groups absorption with addition of Nb2O5 in glasses was clearly shown by IR Spectroscopy in the range 2500â3700cmâ1. The relationship between erbium luminescence at 1535nm, Nb2O5 concentration and OH group nature in niobium borophosphate glasses has been discussed. A fluorination treatment, conducted to reduce the OH group content, has allowed the reduction of the absorption coefficient at 3000cmâ1 by half. Amplification measured at 1535nm has confirmed the beneficial effect of the Nb2O5 introduction on the gain and has been found to be in accordance with the evolution of the luminescence properties.",1
"Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding of IN738LC superalloy was carried out using a rapidly solidified MBF-15 Ni-based foil. The effects of bonding temperature (1130â1170âÂ°C) and time (5â120âmin) as well as foil thickness (35â140âÂµm) were studied on the microstructure of joint region and its mechanical properties. The solidification sequence in the joint region was found to be (i) formation of Î³ solid solution in the isothermally solidified zone, followed by (ii) ternary eutectic of Î³â+âNi3Bâ+âCrB, and finally (iii) binary eutectic of Î³â+âNi3Si in the athermally solidified zone. Fine Ni3Si particles were also formed via a solid state transformation within the Î³ matrix in the vicinity of eutectic products. A deviation of isothermal solidification kinetics from the standard parabolic TLP model was observed by increasing the bonding temperature to 1170âÂ°C, which resulted in the formation of eutectic constituents at the joint centerline. The analysis of mechanical and fractographic test results revealed that the samples with complete isothermal solidification exhibit the highest shear strength, whereas the hard eutectic constituents act as preferential failure sites and lead to a significant reduction in the joint shear strength in samples with incomplete isothermal solidification.",0
"The fully frustrated XY model in two dimensions exhibits a vortex-unbinding as well as an Ising transition. If the Ising transition overlaps with the critical line that ends on the vortex transition: T I â©½ T v, then the model is equivalent, at the overlap temperature, to a free massless field theory of 1 boson and 1 Majorana fermion, which is a superconformal field theory, of central charge c = 3 2 . The model is experimentally realized in terms of an array of Josephson-tunnel junctions in a transverse magnetic field. The experiment reveals a phase transition consistent with T I = T v. Thus, at the critical temperature, the array provides a physical realization of a supersymmetric quantum field theory.",0
"Tellurite glasses with different concentrations of Nd3+ ions and WO3 oxide were prepared using melt-quenching technique. The prepared glasses were characterized by the absorption spectrum, emission spectrum, Raman spectrum, fluorescence decay curve and DSC curve measurements, together with Judd-Ofelt intensity parameter, radiative transition probability and fluorescence branching ratio calculations to reveal the effects of Nd3+ and WO3 concentration on the structure, photo-luminescence and thermal stability. Under the excitation of 808nm LD, three near-infrared band fluorescence emissions at around 0.9, 1.06 and 1.34Î¼m, corresponding to the transitions from the 4F3/2 â 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 levels respectively, are observed, and the fluorescence intensities increase with the increase of doped Nd3+ concentration up to 0.6mol%. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensities continue to increase greatly with the introduction of WO3 oxide. Compared with 0.6mol% Nd3+-doped glass without WO3 oxide, the luminescent intensity of 1.06Î¼m band increases by about 95% in the glass with 9mol% amount of WO3, which is mainly attributed to the rapid population of Nd3+ ions in the excited level 4F3/2 due to the enhanced multi-phonon relaxation process with the increased phonon energy of glass host. Therefore, the enhanced luminescent intensity as well as the good thermal stability demonstrated by DSC curve indicate that the prepared 0.6mol% Nd3+-doped tellurite glass with 9mol% amount of WO3 oxide is a potential gain medium applied for near-infrared band solid-state lasers and fiber amplifiers.",1
"The sensitization mechanisms of Yb3+ to Tm3+ for the blue upconversion luminescence in fluorophosphate glass were studied. Two different mechanisms exist in the sensitization. One is the sequential sensitization that Tm3+ is excited from 3H6 to 1G4 through absorbing three photons transferred from Yb3+ one by one. Another is the cooperative sensitization that two Yb3+ ions form a couple cluster firstly, and then the couple cluster Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to Tm3+ and excite it to 1G4. With the increment of the concentration of Yb3+ ions, the sequential sensitization becomes weak and the cooperative sensitization becomes intense, and the transformation trend of sensitization mechanism with the increment of Yb3+ concentration can be clarified by the introduction of Tb3+ ions in the glass.",1
"A mixed alkali germano-phosphate glass composition (Li0.5Na0.5Ge2(PO4)3) has been prepared and characterized. The crystallization mechanism of a NZP-type phase, the nucleation rate and the non-isothermal kinetic parameters have been studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA). The plot of the DTA peak height versus the glass particle size has shown a great tendency for surface crystallization. The nucleation rate type curves have given a maximum at 465Â±2Â°C and confirmed that nucleation was instantaneous at this temperature. Furthermore, the average value of the Avrami exponent (5.4Â±0.4) has revealed a tri-dimensional growth controlled by the development of the glassâcrystal interface with a decreasing nucleation rate in the temperature range explored. From non-isothermal experiments, the apparent activation energy for the overall crystallization phenomenon has been founded in the range 260â273kJ/mol whereas the activation energy for crystal growth was 488Â±6kJ/mol.",0
The strong-coupling expansion of U(N) gauge theory on a D-dimensional lattice is reformulated in the limit N â â through a set of diagrammatic rules directly for the free energy and Wilson loops. The strong-coupling planar diagrams are interpreted as surfaces embedded in the lattice. The large-N phase transition is related to the entropy of these surfaces. It is shown that the strong-coupling phase of the U(â) gauge theory terminates with a phase transition of Gross-Witten type only in 2 and 3 dimensions. When Dâ©¾4 the large-N singularity takes place in a metastable phase because of an earlier first-order transition to the weak-coupling phase of the theory.,0

"In this contribution, amorphous silicon thin-film solar cells on textile glass fiber fabrics for smart textiles are prepared and the photovoltaic performance is characterized. These solar cells on fabrics delivered open circuit voltages up to 883mV. This shows that shunt-free contacting of the solar cells was successful, even in case of non-planar fabrics. The short-circuit current densities up to 3.7mA/cm2 are limited by transmission losses in a 10nm thin titanium layer, which was used as a semi-transparent contact. The low conductivity of this layer limits the fill factor to 43.1%. Pseudo fill factors, neglecting the series resistance, up to 70.2% were measured. Efficiencies up to 1.4% and pseudo efficiencies up to 2.1% were realized on textile fabrics. A transparent conductive oxide could further improve the efficiency to above 5%.",0
"This work investigated the possibility of producing dense Ti3SiC2 by hot pressing TiC/Si powders. A hot press with graphite heating elements was used for densification and the phase reactions of some hot pressed samples were further evaluated by pressureless heating in a dilatometer. The density and phase composition of the heat treated samples were evaluated using Archimedes principle and by X-ray diffractometry, respectively. Hot pressing resulted in a low Ti3SiC2 yield; the main phases were TiC and TiSi2 regardless of starting powder composition, temperature, holding time or pressure. A second heating without pressure resulted in Ti3SiC2 formation, but only in samples initially hot pressed at 1300Â°C or lower. At higher hot pressing temperatures, thin oxide layers on particle surfaces were locked into the structure. Acting as diffusion barriers, they prevented the Ti3SiC2 forming reaction. In hot pressed samples the density was significantly higher than in samples sintered without pressure.",0
"We have studied nonlinear optical properties of CuInS2x Se2(1âx)-doped silicate glasses. The CuInS2x Se(1âx) particles had the size in the range of 10â30 nm and structured in the glass matrix as fractal aggregates. The transient change of absorption and intensity-dependent transmission under picosecond excitation have been investigated by means of pump-and-probe and single-beam techniques, respectively. We have observed both the bleaching and the induced absorption depending on intensity of excitation and the ratio of the band gap and pump photon energy. The effects observed have been discussed.",1
"The experiments demonstrate that ductility of the samples of bulk metallic glass (BMG) with the same chemical composition increased with decreasing sample size. It is shown that microhardness and density increases with decreasing the cooling rate. The fracture morphology of rods after compressive fracture were different on the cross section. Two characteristic features of the compressive fracture morphologies of metallic glasses (MGs) were observed in samples: smooth region and the vein pattern. Many parallel shear bands were observed on the deformed specimen with Ï =2mm in diameter. The results provide more understanding on the relationship among the cooling rate, structure and micro-indentation behavior of the Fe-Co-based BMGs.",0
"Nowadays composite materials are indispensable but the supply is limited. In particularly, the supply of material is limited for specific applications.

"We report on spectroscopic properties and energy transfer of Tm3+/Ho3+-codoped tungsten tellurite glasses for 1.47Î¼m amplifier. Fluorescence spectra and the analysis of energy transfer indicate that Ho3+ is an excellent codopant for 1.47Î¼m emission. Comparing with other tellurite glasses, the radiative lifetime of the 3H4 level of Tm3+ in tungsten tellurite glass is slightly lower, but the spontaneous emission probability, stimulated emission cross-section and the figure of merit for bandwidth are obviously larger. Although the pump efficiency of tungsten tellurite amplifier is â¼50% less than that of fluoride glass, the figure of merit for bandwidth is approximately three times larger in tungsten tellurite glass than in fluoride glass. The results indicate that Tm3+/Ho3+-codoped tungsten tellurite glass is attractive for broadband amplifier.",1
"The role played by electron correlation in determining the magnetic properties of transition metals is reviewed. The successes of band theory, local spin density functional methods and the random phase approximation are discussed. These include calculations of electron and spin density distributions, the form of the Fermi surface, the spin susceptibility at T = 0 and spin wave energies. However, it is shown that the energy dependence of the self-energy, not included in a local potential, is important for determining quasi-particle energies away from the Fermi surface, such as the top of the majority spin band in nickel. This energy dependence is also essential for understanding the low temperature behaviour of the spin susceptibility of paramagnetic metals. The transition to a Curie-Weiss law at higher temperatures is discussed. The experimental observation of spin waves above the Curie temperature in ferromagnetic metals indicates long range spin correlations which may be understood in nickel using a model of three quasi-two-dimensional sub-bands. A new approach to very weak itinerant-electron ferromagnets, based on Hund's rule interactions between strongly-correlated paramagnetic sub-bands, is outlined.",0
A high intensity ultrasonic liquid processor was used to infuse 0.1â0.4wt.% carbon nanofibers (CNFs) into the polyester matrix which was then mixed with a catalyst using a high speed mechanical agitator. Both conventional and nanophased glass fiber reinforced polyester composites (GRPCs) were fabricated using the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed best dispersion of CNFs in the 0.2wt.% CNF-loaded resin. Proper resin flow and impregnation of the glass fibers were also seen in the SEM micrographs. DMA studies exhibited about 49.5% increase in the storage modulus and about 3Â°C increase in the glass transition temperature (Tg ) due to the incorporation of CNFs into the GRPC. TMA studies also showed better thermal stability and lower thermal expansion in the CNF-loaded GRPC. CNF-loaded GRPC showed higher ILSS due to better interfacial bonding between the fiber and matrix due to the presence of CNFs. Fracture morphology studied by both optical microscope (OM) and SEM revealed better interfacial bonding in the CNF-loaded GRPC.,1
Er-doped glassy As2S3 and As2Se3 films are prepared by vacuum co-evaporation of chalcogenide glass and Er chalcogenide powder. The films display strong 1.54 Î¼m photoluminescence (PL) and keep the possibility of the photostructural transformations and photoinduced anisotropy. The used method is believed to be applied for preparation of different chalcogenide glassy films doped by various rare-earth elements.,1
"A functionalization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) monolayer of a hydroxylated glass surface, followed by the surface initiated graft radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) using amino groups of APTES monolayer chemical bonded with glass surface and Ce4+ as a redox initiating system. The microstructure of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) film obtained from the redox graft polymerization on the modified glass surfaces was examined by water contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the results showed that about 60 nm thickness of thermosensitive polymer (PNIPAm) film successfully formed.",0
"We report waveguides in Ni-doped Li2OâGa2O3âSiO2 (Ni:LGS) glass and glassâceramic (GC) fabricated with a femtosecond (fs) laser with repetition rate of 1kHz. When the glass is annealed to form a GC, the waveguides are erased. However, in the GC the waveguides are not erased by annealing. In Ni:LGS GC a 415nm absorption band was created by fs laser waveguide writing due to the creation of Ni nanoparticles with an estimated diameter of a few nm. Raman and photoluminescence spectra of the bulk and waveguide structures were indistinguishable; however, fluorescence decay profiles indicated more long lifetime components in the waveguide compared to the bulk.",1
"MnO2 multilayer nanosheet clusters were prepared via electrochemical deposition route, which shows simpleness and high efficiency. The growth process of MnO2 multilayer nanosheet clusters was investigated in this paper. The deposited MnO2 films were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS. In addition, it was also electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry in 1.0M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The MnO2 multilayer nanosheet clusters show a big specific capacitance, and it can be achieved about 521.5Fgâ1 at 5mVsâ1. These materials also have a high electrochemical stability.",0
"Anomalous X-ray scattering experiments have been performed on glassy As2Se3 at room temperature in order to clarify the role of each constituent for short- and intermediate-range order. The experiments were performed using intense X-rays from a third-generation synchrotron facility, ESRF. Differential structure factors, Î i S(Q), close to the As and Se K edges were obtained from a detailed analysis. The prepeak around Q =12nmâ1 in the total structure factor, S(Q), indicating evidence of intermediate-range order, is dominated by the AsâAs correlation around 12nmâ1 and the SeâSe correlation around 14.5nmâ1. The origin of the prepeak is carefully discussed.",0
"This work reports the observation of emissions at 2.9Î¼m, 1.8Î¼m and 1.47Î¼m from Dy3+/Tm3+ codoped fluorophosphate glass upon excitation of a conventional 800nm laser diode. JuddâOfelt intensity parameters and radiative properties of Dy3+ ions in present glasses were calculated using the JuddâOfelt theory. The mechanism and microparameters of energy transfer processes were investigated based on photoluminescence performance and lifetime measurements. The Dy3+/Tm3+ codoped fluorophosphate glass possessing advantageous spectroscopic characteristics as well as excellent thermal stability is a promising candidate for an efficient 2.9Î¼m laser.",1
"In the case of Î²-RH 2 + x systems (Rârare earth; 0 < x < 1), the fraction x of the hydrogen atoms located in the octahedral interstitial sites of the f.c.c. metal lattice undergoes order-disorder and order-order transformations. The strength of these transformations and the possibility of their experimental observation in the investigation of the thermal properties of metal-hydrogen compounds can be estimated by calculating the temperature dependence of the internal energy, E Ì (T), and of the specific heat, C(T) = â E Ì (T) âT . The calculation is applied for the case of the LaH2 + x -like systems, with different concentrations x and different energy-parameter ratios p â¡ V2 V1 .",0
"Eu2+/Sm3+ co-doped silicate glass was prepared by high temperature melting under reducing atmosphere and the Eu2+/Sm3+ co-doped SrSiO3 transparent glass-ceramics were obtained after heat-treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra confirmed the formation of SrSiO3 nano-crystals in the glass matrix. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were measured. A broad emission band from 400nm to 550nm due to the 4f65d1 â4f7 transitions of Eu2+ was observed, as well as several sharp emission peaks at 563nm, 600nm, 646nm and 713nm ascribed to the 4fâ4f transitions of Sm3+. The luminescence properties of the glass ceramics with different molar ratio of Eu2+/Sm3+ were studied and the corresponding chromaticity coordinates were calculated. The ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED) excitable glass-ceramics emitting white light were obtained by tuning the relative emission intensity of Eu2+ and Sm3+. The results indicate that the Eu2+/Sm3+ co-doped SrSiO3 transparent glass-ceramics can be used as a potential matrix material for White LED under UV-LED excitation.",1
Tm3+-doped GeS2âIn2S3âCsBr chalcohalide glasses are presented and their infrared luminescence properties at S-band are investigated. Composition of glass matrix is 70GeS2â10In2S3â20CsBr (mol%) with the concentration of Tm2S3 in the range of 0.05â0.5mol%. The results showed that the optimal Tm2S3 doping concentration was 0.38mol% at which the glass exhibited an enhanced emission peaking at 1480nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) over 100nm.,1
"The objective of this paper was to study the fatigue characteristics of zirconium (Zr)-based bulk-metallic glasses (BMGs) and to investigate the mechanisms of fatigue-crack initiation, crack propagation, and fracture in BMGs. The fatigue ratios (fatigue limit/tensile strength) (0.30â0.55) of Zr-based BMGs were found to be generally comparable with those of crystalline alloys, such as steel and titanium alloys. Fatigue cracks typically initiate from shear bands, inclusions, and/or porosities. The striations resulting from the blunting and resharpening of the fatigue-crack tip formed in the fatigue-crack-growth region. The fine striation spacing seems to be comparable to that of the crystalline alloys.",0
"Tb3+ doped X-ray conversion glassy screen with an industrial scale (50mmÃ50mmÃ12mm) was successfully fabricated, and its luminescent properties and applications in CCD imaging system were investigated. Results showed that Tb3+ doped silicate glasses mainly emit weak blue (400â460nm) and strong green (480â570nm) fluorescence. With the increase of Tb3+ ion concentration, the intensity of green emission increases, but that of blue emission decreases. Gd3+ ions can sensitize the luminescence of Tb3+ ions among silicate glasses. With the increase of CeO2 concentration, the luminescent intensity of Tb3+ doped silicate glasses at 550nm quickly decreases. However, the irradiation resistance of Tb3+ doped silicate glasses can be effectively improved by CeO2 addition. The imaging quality of the luminescent glass screen is more excellent than that of Gd2O2S polycrystalline screens.",1
"The effect of Si addition on the glass-forming ability (GFA) of (Zr47Cu44Al9)100âx Si x (x =0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.5) metallic glass alloys was investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The maximum diameter of glassy rods increased from 4mm for the Zr47Cu44Al9 alloy to 6mm for the (Zr47Cu44Al9)98.5Si1.5 alloy without detectable crystallinity when prepared using copper mould casting. Different criteria are used to evaluate the influence of Si content on the GFA. Due to the suppression of the formation of the primary CuZr phase and the induction of the composition close to the eutectic point, properly adding Si can enhance the GFA of the (Zr47Cu44Al9)100âx Si x alloy. The possible mechanisms involved in the achievement of this GFA are also discussed.",0
"Precise low-frequency internal friction measurements on vitreous silica, taken over a wide temperature ( 4 K < T < 300 K) and frequency range (40Hz < Î½ < 14kHz), show remarkable similarities, but also suggestive differences with recent light-scattering experiments. In the interval 30 K < T < 110 K, the exponent Î± ( T ) of the power-law relaxational spectrum at low frequencies turns out to be proportional to T â T k , with a minimum at around T k = 13 K. This phenomenon is interpreted as a manifestation of quenched spatial disorder.",1
"Scores of modern applications have the presence of composite materials. As such, scientists worldwide started considering fabrication of a new composite and attempting to have more applications using these materials. Fabricating composite materials newly has become the genuine considerations of scientific community worldwide and hence, serious attempts are continuously being taken in-order to improve the application of these materials. Due to this vast development and research in this field, conscious attempt has been made in this present work that studies the effect of nanoclay content with reference to structural and morphological behavior of epoxy composites. In this process, epoxy materials get reinforced with different particulate fractions of chosen nanoclay and investigations were carried out on the specimens. Composite laminate with varied layers of glass fiber and kevlar fiber and modified epoxy with 2â¯wt.% of Cloisite 30B and hardener are used, and strips are fabricated and tested for their mechanical properties. Also, sheets with 14 layers of glass without and with nanoclay and likewise sheets with 14 layers of kevlar without and with nanoclay were fabricated. The fabricated kevlar/glass fiber reinforced composites were subjected to various tests to evaluate the thermal properties. All specimens were prepared under the specifications of ASTM standard. Thermal testing of composites (glass transition temperature, thermo gravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analysis) has been conducted and the properties have been evaluated.",0
"This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the interfacial bond strength of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars in high-strength concrete cube. The experimental program consisted of testing 54 concrete cube specimens prepared according to CSA S802-02 standard. Two main parameters were considered in the experimental investigation: the compressive strength of concrete (from 25.6MPa to 92.4MPa) and the type of rebar (steel, sand-coated GFRP, and helically wrapped GFRP). The test results showed that the interfacial bond strength of the GFRP bars increased as the compressive strength of concrete increased. However, the increasing rate of the bond strength of the GFRP bars with respect to the concrete strength was much smaller than that of the steel bars. The concrete specimens were sawn in half after the test for a closer investigation of the actual mode of bond failure. Visual examination of the specimens showed that bond failure of the steel bar was caused by concrete crushing against the face of the ribs, while bond failure of the GFRP bars occurred not only in the concrete but also in the bars by delamination of the resin-rich outer layer from the fiber core. The average area of the delaminated resin-rich layer of the GFRP bar increased with increasing compressive strength of concrete.",0
"Zr61.7Al8Ni13Cu17Sn0.3 bulk metallic glass samples with different aspect ratios in the range of 0.25â2.25 were deformed by compression, and the effect of aspect ratio on the evolution of shear bands was investigated. It is found that for the deformed Zr61.7Al8Ni13Cu17Sn0.3 bulk metallic glass, the average shear band spacing decreases and the shear band density increases monotonically as the aspect ratio increases from 0.25 to 2.25. A minimal average shear band spacing of 0.478âÂµm is achieved for the sample with an aspect ratio of 2.25. In addition, the fractions of shear bands with spacings below 100 and 50ânm are about 12.84% and 6.76%, respectively, for the sample with an aspect ratio of 2.25. The reason for the formation of a higher density of shear bands can probably be attributed to the increase of the driving force for the sample with a larger aspect ratio.",0
Surfaces of bulk glassy Zr59Ti3Cu20Al10Ni8 samples were shot-peened for different times and their corrosion behaviour was tested in 0.01M Na2SO4 + xM NaCl (x =0; 0.01; 0.1) and 6M HCl. Slight improvement of spontaneous passivity but a decrease of pitting resistance are detected with prolonged shot-peening duration. The corrosion damage evolution is governed by the nature of the mechanically generated defects and their surrounding stress fields.,0
"Composites are playing significant role in material industries, which seek composites to be cost-effective and environment friendly materials. Natural fibre are new fibre which has some characters that can be useful for material industries .Flax and kenaf one of the many natural fibre which are light in weight and biodegradable in nature. However, the mechanical properties of natural fibre are lacking behind compare to synthetic fibre .Thus, assessment of mechanical properties of natural fibre is necessary to improve the structural or mechanical application by hybridization. In this study , three point bending (flexural) test , barcol hardness , vibration test and three body abrasive wear properties are evaluated .The hardness of carbon fibre is 76.6% more than flax fibre ,which make carbon fibre more brittle material . Flexural modulus of synthetic fibre is moderately higher than natural fibre .The wear rate is determine with sliding distance of 1000m and applied load of 25.5N when applied on specimen, the natural fibre has low wear rate which make it suitable in abrasive environment. The impact energy storage capacity of glass fibre is more than other fibers such as carbon, flex, kenaf fibre. Vibration frequency of natural fibre is comparatively similar to synthetic fibre, and carbon fibre has natural frequency 28.9% more than kenaf fibre. For structural application, having higher natural frequency helps in designing mechanical components. Future scope of natural fibre is by making hybrid composite with synthetic fibre which may be a new revolution to composite materials. This increases the degradation life and performance of composite.",0
"To seek the possibility of an efficient 1.3 Î¼m amplifier in oxide materials, the concentration and temperature dependence of fluorescence properties of the Pr3+ : 1G4 â 3H5 at 1.3 Î¼m and Yb 3+:2 F 5/2 â 2 F 7/2 at 1 Î¼m were investigated in codoped tellurite glasses with compositions of 75TeO2â20ZnOâ5Na2OâxPr2O3âyYb2O3. By 0.97 Î¼m pumping, the 1.3 Î¼m emission of Pr3+ was sensitized by the YbâPr energy transfer. The lifetime obtained by 1.02 Î¼m emission of Yb3+ at room temperature was concentration quenched with the presence of only 0.1 mol% Pr2O3. The energy transfer efficiency from Yb to Pr in a codoped glass was found to be more than 90% even in the glass of [Yb]/[Pr]>100. With increasing temperature, the Yb-lifetime in singly doped glass increased and that in codoped glass decreased. These results can be explained by assuming rapid energy migration between Yb ions and promotion of Yb3+ : 2 F 5/2 â Pr 3+: 1 G 4 transfer at higher temperature.",1
"Fluoride glasses singly and co-doped with Ho3+ and Er3+ ions have been synthesized. Using a conventional 800nm laser diode, intense mid-infrared emissions around 2Î¼m, 1.55Î¼m and 2.7Î¼m are successfully obtained in present Ho3+/Er3+ co-doped ZBLAY fluoride glass. The optical properties and energy transfer mechanism for intense emissions are characterized. The 2Î¼m emission lifetime of present glass can reach as high as 14.16ms. Based on the absorption, fluorescence spectra and lifetime measurements, it is found that Er3+ ions can transfer their energy to Ho3+ ions with high efficiency. Hence, Ho3+/Er3+ co-doped ZBLAY glass possessing advantageous spectroscopic characteristics is a potential cost-effective host for the mid-infrared solid state lasers.",1
"(Bi0.8Pb0.2)4Sr3Ca3Cu4O x glasses were prepared by a standard technique of quenching homogenised and melted substrates.

"Composites have a greater influence in recent development of materials with high strength to weight ratio. In the present scenario an effort is on to identify the different and specific properties which are to be possessed by the same material to attain the possibility of using it in various applications. The composite materials play a major role in achieving that requirement. Most of the natural fiber composite materials possess good mechanical properties but it is now becoming necessary that it should possess other properties as well like resistance to water absorption, fire proof, etc,. Here in this investigation an attempt has been made to study mechanical properties and the resistance to water absorption in Kenaf, Aloe-vera and Sisal Fibers reinforced by addition of Glass fiber.",0
"An experimental programme has been carried out to study the mechanical performance of resin transfer moulded composites comprising a weft-knit glass fabric of Milano-rib architecture. A number of mechanical properties i.e. tension, compression, bearing, impact and post-impact compression, were considered for laminates containing up to 12 layers of knitted fabric. With respect to more conventional composites, the knitted composites were found to have relatively poor tension and compression properties, but comparable bearing performance, and superior energy absorption and post-damage properties.",0
"Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and inelastic neutron scattering studies were performed on a polycrystalline sample of (Pd9 9.65Fe0.35)95Mn5. This system exhibits a sequence of phase transitions from a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state and then a transition to spin-glass-like behavior near T SG = 3.0 K. The temperature dependence of the SANS exhibits a peak at T c = 9.0 K and then a Q-dependent increase at low temperatures. This low temperature behavior contrasts sharply with that observed at low temperatures for a normal ferromagnet. No spin waves were observed within the ferromagnetic phase for the momenta values probed. Instead, a broad (FWHM â¼ 5.0 meV) quasielastic distribution which was almost temperature independent was observed. This scattering was interpreted as a measure of the distribution of the magnetic energies of the Mn2+ ions.",0
"The present investigation is focused on montmorillonite (CloisiteÂ® Na+)-based vinylester/glass fiber composites. In the present study, two types of composites are processed by incorporating 1.0wt% untreated and treated montmorillonite into vinylester/glass fiber composites and the effect of seawater absorption on their mechanical properties was studied for marine applications. The surface treatment of MMT was performed using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. When montmorillonite clay comes into contact with water, swelling between layers occurs that consequently alters the mechanical properties of the composites. The tensile and bending strengths of the composites before and after seawater absorption were investigated using ASTM methods with a Universal Testing Machine. Chemical and physical changes were studied through X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed to analyze the effect of seawater absorption on the thermal properties. The morphology of the fractured surfaces before and after seawater absorption was analyzed using FE-SEM. The results show that treated MMT-based composites show better mechanical properties in dry and seawater-absorbed conditions than the untreated MMT-based composites, but the mechanical properties of both composites decrease after seawater immersion.",0
"Cross sections for the excitation by electrons of the 3â level at 2.61 MeV in 208Pb have been obtained between 0.5 fmâ1 and 2.8 fmâ1 momentum transfer.

The data at high momentum transfer, however, indicate that the transition density has a detailed structure. A transition density which fits the data is presented and compared to theoretical predictions.",0
"We studied the spectroscopic characteristics of telluride glass with the host composition (0.85)TeO2â(0.15)WO3, containing 0.25 and 1.0mol% thulium oxide (Tm2O3). By analyzing the absorption spectra with the JuddâOfelt theory, the average radiative lifetimes of 305Â±7.5Î¼s and 1.95Â±0.02ms were determined for the 3F4 and 3H4 levels, respectively. Measured fluorescence lifetime of the 3F4 level decreased from 218 to 51Î¼s for the 0.25 and 1.0mol% Tm2O3 doped samples, respectively, indicating the effect of boosted non-radiative decay at higher doping concentrations. A similar trend was observed for the 3H4 level, where the fluorescence lifetime decreased from 1.86ms to 350Î¼s at these concentrations. The quenching of the 1460nm (3F4â3H4) emission in favor of the 1800nm (3H4â3H6) emission due to cross relaxation was further evident in the fluorescence spectra of the samples. The calculated stimulated emission cross sections (3.73Â±0.1Ã10â21 cm2 at 1460nm and 6.57Â±0.07Ã10â21 cm2 at 1808nm) reveal the potential importance of the Tm3+:(0.85)TeO2â(0.15)WO3 glass for applications in fiber-optic amplifiers and fiber lasers.",1
"In this paper, we present the photoluminescence properties of Pr3+, Sm3+ and Er3+ doped phosphate glasses. Optical absorption and emission spectra of lanthanide active ions in P2O5âCaOâSrOâBaO glass have been investigated at room temperature. These glasses have shown strong absorption bands in the near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) region. For Pr3+ doped glass, emission bands centered at 608nm (3P0 â 3H6 + 1D2 â 3H4), 640nm (3P0 â 3F2), 686nm (3P0â3F3) and 723nm (3P0 â 3F4) have been observed with 480nm (3H4 â 3P0) excitation wavelength. Of them, 686nm has shown bright red emission. Emission bands of (4G5/2 â 6H5/2) 560nm, (4G5/2 â 6H7/2) 600nm and (4G5/2 â 6H9/2) 645nm for the Sm3+ phosphate glass, with excitation at (6H5/2 â 4F7/2) 400nm have been recorded. With regard to the Er3+ phosphate glass, a bright fluorescent greenâyellow emission at 546nm (4S3/2 â 4I15/2) have been observed. Analysis of decay curves of luminescence revealed occurrence of the strong luminescence quenching originating from the 3P0 metastable level of Pr3+ and 4S3/2 state of Er3+ mainly by a multiphonon relaxation processes to 1D2, 4F9/2 levels respectively. Moreover these results are compared with those obtained by using the JuddâOfelt theory.

"Different concentrations of Dy3+ ions doped lithium zinc borosilicate glasses of chemical composition (30-x) B2O3 - 25 SiO2 -10 Al2O3 -30 LiF - 5 ZnO - x Dy2O3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mol%) were prepared by the melt quenching technique. The prepared glasses were investigated through X-ray diffraction, optical absorption, photoluminescence and decay measurements. Intensities of absorption bands expressed in terms of oscillator strengths (f) were used to determine the Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters Î©Î» (Î» = 2, 4 and 6). The evaluated J-O parameters were used to determine the radiative parameters such as transition probabilities (AR), total transition probability rate (AT), radiative lifetime (ÏR) and branching ratios (Î²R) for the excited 4F9/2 level of Dy3+ ions.

As a result, the investigated samples with excellent spectroscopic properties might be appropriate optical materials for mid-infrared laser and amplifier applications.",1
"Five types of posts from three different manufacturers (RTD, France, Carbotech, France and Ivoclar-Vivadent, Liechenstein) were subjected to three-point bending tests in order to obtain fatigue results, flexural strength and modulus. Transverse and longitudinal polished sections were examined by scanning electron microscopy and evaluated by computer-assisted image analysis. Physical parameters, including volume % of fibers, their dispersion index and coordination number, were calculated and correlated with mechanical properties. The weaker posts showed more fiber dispersion, higher resin contents, larger numbers of visible defects and reduced fatigue resistance. The flexural strength was inversely correlated with fiber diameter and the flexural modulus was weakly related to coordination number, volume % of fibers and dispersion index. The interfacial adhesion between the silica fibers and the resin matrix was observed to be of paramount importance.",0
"Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) is a p-type semiconductor material and an attractive absorber for thin films solar cells due to its unique optical and electrical properties. The low cost of this technology is based on its application on ecological substrates (glass, ceramic or glass-ceramic materials), effective uses of raw materials and lower thickness of the film (range from 1.5 to 3â¯Âµm). In this work, a new glass-ceramic substrate has been developed using industrial wastes materials (recycled glass, bottom ash and fly ash from a thermal power plant) used as support in thin film solar cell technology. The CIGS absorber has been synthesized by an easy and low-cost way of preparation using the co-precipitation method. The solar cell device has been completed and fully characterized.

"Dispersions of air in gelatine solutions were experimentally investigated in a 2.75mm circular vertical tube coupled to a microfluidic device. Air and gelatine solutions (1%, 3% and 5% w/w) were mixed in the microfluidic device to produce steady flows of microbubbles by controlling liquid and gas volumetric flow rates. A two-phase flow map and transition lines between flow regimes were examined. In the bubbling regime (e.g., low air fraction) it was possible to produce mono and polydispersed micron-size air bubbles of controllable sizes. In the foam regime (e.g., high air fraction) the foam structure mainly depended on the liquid flow rate. Moreover, uniform foams moved as rigid bodies along the capillary tube, lubricated at the wall by the gelatine solution.",0
"The Eu3+-doped CaO-Gd2O3-SiO2-B2O3 glasses were prepared to study photoluminescence, lasing potential and scintillation properties. Glasses absorb photons in ultraviolet, visible light and near infrared regions and are assigned to the energy transitions of Gd3+ and Eu3+. Ultraviolet with 275nm can generate the strong red emission with 614nm via energy transfer form Gd3+ to Eu3+. X-ray scintillation study exhibits strong emission pattern due to Gd-Eu energy transfer. The optimum concentrations of Eu3+ ion in this glass is 0.30mol% as it results maximum emission intensity. The fluorescence lifetime of the 5D0 level decreases from 1.763 to 1.726ms when concentration increased from 0.05 to 0.40mol%. From Judd-Ofelt analysis, this glass exhibit high potential for using as laser medium for red laser device with high lasing power and energy extraction ratio. Moreover, this glass performs the integral scintillation efficiency as 13% compared with BGO.",1
"Transition metal oxide (NiO) nanoparticles decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NiO/MWCNT nanocomposites, NCs) were prepared by a facile solution method using reducing agents in alkaline medium. The NiO/MWCNT NCs were characterized by UV/vis, FT-IR, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (XEDS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and scanning electron microscopy (TEM). The NiO NPs or NiO/MWCNTs were deposited separately on flat glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with conducting binders (5% nafion) to result in a sensor that has a fast response towards selective chloroform (CHCl3). Features including high-sensitivity, lower-detection limit, reliability, reproducibility, ease of integration, long-term stability, selective, and enhanced electrochemical performances are investigated in details. It is detailed studied the sensor performances with NiO NPs/GCE and NiO/MWCNT/GCE electrodes separately and found that NiO/MWCNT/GCE exhibits the higher sensitivity and lower detection limit compared to NiO/GCE assembly. The calibration plot is linear (r 2 =0.9763) over concentration range (3.5nM to 35.0mM) with NiO/MWCNT/GCE. The sensitivity and detection limit was calculated for NiO/MWCNT/GCE as â¼917.7nA/cm2 Î¼M and 0.1034Â±0.0002nM (at a signal-to-noise-ratio, SNR of 3) respectively. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed chemi-sensors can be applied and effectively utilized for the detection of toxic chloroform compound in environmental and healthcare fields in broad scales.",0
"Intense near-infrared emission located at 1.23Î¼m wavelength originating from the erbium (Er3+):4S3/2 â 4I11/2 transition is observed in Er3+-doped fluorotellurite glasses. This emission is mainly contributed by the relatively low phonon energy of the fluorotellurite glass host (â¼776cmâ1). JuddâOfelt analysis indicates a strong asymmetry and covalent environment between Er3+ ions and ligands in the host matrix. The emission cross-section was calculated to be 2.85Ã10â21 cm2 by the FÃ¼chtbauerâLadenburg equation, and the population inversion is realized according to a simplified evaluation. The results suggest that the fluorotellurite glass system could be a promising candidate for the development of optical amplifiers and lasers operating at the relatively unexplored 1.2Î¼m wavelength region.",1
"A new method based on the use of germanium monoselenide as a germanium-containing component of the batch for preparing especially pure Ge-Se glasses has been developed. Glass samples of Ge20Se80 composition with hydrogen impurity content in the form of SeH-groups of 1.2â2.6â¯ppm (at) and of oxygen in the form of Ge-O of 0.1â0.2â¯ppm (wt) have been produced. A single-index optical fiber with a diameter of 220â¯Î¼m is fabricated from the purest Ge20Se80 glass sample by using the crucible method. In the spectrum of total optical losses of the single-index fiber, there are selective impurity absorption bands of SeH-groups with an intensity of 1.5â¯dB/m at a wavelength of 4.51â¯Î¼m, Ge-O (0.3â¯dB/m at 7.9â¯Î¼m), and Si-O (4.1â¯dB/m at 9.2â¯Î¼m). The optical losses in the single-index fiber in the spectral range 5â8â¯Î¼m were at the level of 1.2â1.6â¯dB/m; the minimum optical losses were 0.9â¯dB/m at a wavelength of 7.1â¯Î¼m.",1
"Breakthrough of glass forming ability limitation has been a longstanding pursuit in metallic glasses. In present work, an ultrasonic welding technology was used to achieve this goal. The La55Al25Ni5Cu10Co5 rods were bonded together. Results of computed tomography and scanning electron microscope show that the weld seam tends to narrow gradually and disappear with the increase of welding energy. X-ray diffraction indicated that it preserves completely amorphous structure. In addition, the hardness of the weld position increased with the increase of energy, showing the interfaces bonded together.",0
"This study investigates the interply hybridization of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminate to improve the flexural performance and cost efficiency. Carbon layers were replaced partially by basalt and/or glass fibres to explore the effects of hybrid ratio and stacking sequence on the flexural behavior and material usage. Hybrid laminates were manufactured by vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. Three-point bending tests were carried out to characterize the flexural properties and failure mechanisms of the hybrid composite laminates. The fracture surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that flexural strength and modulus of the hybrid laminates decreased with the increase in the hybrid ratio of basalt fibres ranging from 0 to 50%; however negligible effects on flexural properties were observed when hybrid ratio increased further up to 75%. For the hybrid samples, a higher flexural modulus can be obtained by placing carbon layers on the both tensile and compressive sides symmetrically; and a higher flexural strength can be achieved by placing basalt or glass fibre through a sandwich-like stacking sequence with a hybrid ratio of 50%. The finite element modeling and classic laminate theory (CLT) analysis were also conducted through validation against the experimental results, which enabled to reveal the details of strain, damage and fracture under bending. The study exhibited a better material efficiency for glass/carbon hybrid laminates in terms of strength/cost and modulus/cost ratio; and the benefits of such cost efficiency of hybridization were discussed in depth for potential engineering applications.",0
The glass transition temperature of poly(3-Br-N-vinylcarbazole) has been determined by calorimetric studies.

"ABSTRACT In order to investigate the effects of Al2O3 and TiO2 on the bioactivity of glasses, compositional dependence of apatite formation on the glasses in the systems CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 and CaO-SiO2-TiO2 were studied in vitro. The addition of Al2O3 and TiO2 to CaO-SiO2-based glasses suppressed the dissolution of Ca(II) and Si(IV) and hence reduced the increasing rate of supersaturation of the simulated body fluid with respect to apatite. Those additives was also suggested to decrease apatite nucleation ability of the hydrated silica.",1
"Discontinuous precipitation (DP) produces precipitate plates that have a distinct orientation relationship with the matrix and nanoscale widths and spacings. For structural alloys a DP structure limited to the grain boundary regions is undesirable since it degrades the mechanical properties due to the inhomogeneity of the microstructure. In Al-Co-Ni alloys, the DP transformation can go to completion and the mechanical properties of such structures have been studied in this work. The hardness, tensile and creep properties of alloy samples with DP structure were investigated. The results imply that the occurrence and complete transformation of DP will have a favorable effect on the hardness and tensile strength of the sample while lowering the ductility. A method to generate serrated grain boundaries based on the DP transformation is demonstrated. Such structures are found to increase the creep resistance in a limited temperature and loading range.",0
"Structural and spectroscopic properties of varying concentrations of Er3+ ion in P2O5- PbO-K2O-Al2O3-Na2O (PPbKANEr) glasses were studied before and after consecutive Î³-ray irradiation. FTIR spectra of all the contemplated glasses confirm the presence of characteristic vibrational bands mainly because of phosphate groups. The optical absorption spectra of Er2O3-doped glasses are more stable and do not exhibit any variations after Î³-ray irradiation particularly when Er3+ ions are present in higher concentrations. Judd-Ofelt (JO) analysis was carried out for Î³-ray irradiated glasses and the resultant three phenomenological intensity parameters were found to be Î©2 =â¯1.98, Î©4 =â¯0.78 and Î©6 =â¯1.24 (Ã10â20 cm2). A bright emission corresponding to 4S3/2 â 4I15/2 transition in the green region was observed with the excitation of 379â¯nm. Broad luminescence peak at 1535â¯nm (4I13/2 â 4I15/2) are observed in the region of 1400â1700â¯nm with the excitation of 980â¯nm. The important spectroscopic properties such as absorption (Ïabs(Î»)) and emission cross-sections (Ïemi(Î»)), gain band width (FWHM Ã Ïemi(Î»)) for 4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transition at 1.53â¯Âµm were assessed for Î³-ray irradiated PPbKANEr1.0 glass and the values found to be 6.73â¯Ãâ¯10â21 cm2, 7.33â¯Ãâ¯10â21 cm2 and 264â¯Ãâ¯10â28 (cm3), respectively. The decay curves for the 4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transition of the Î³-ray irradiated PPbKANEr glasses exhibit exponential nature and the lifetimes found to be decreased (3.72â0.62â¯ms) with the increasing Er2O3 concentration (0.05â4.0â¯mol%). The upconversion luminescence spectra exhibit two emissions at 525â¯nm (2H11/2 â 4I15/2) and 543â¯nm (4S3/2 â 4I15/2) in the green region along with a fairly feeble red emission at around 650â¯nm (4F9/2 â 4I15/2).",1
"In this study, the SnO2-graphene-carbon (SnO2-G-C) nanofibers are synthetized via an electrospinning method and employed as potential KIB anodes. The SnO2-G-C anodes exhibit a great cycling stability of 202.06â¯mAâ¯h/g over 100 cycles at the current density of 100â¯mA/g, as well as the high rate capacity of 114.81â¯mAâ¯h/g at 1â¯A/g. The enhanced electrochemical properties of SnO2-G-C comparing to SnO2-carbon (SnO2-C) counterpart can be ascribed to the dispersive graphene inside the carbon nanofibers, which offers flexible buffer matrix and protects the active materials from destruction. Meanwhile, the graphene facilitates the electrons transportation, leading to the good rate capability.",0
"Spectroscopic properties and energy transfer (ET) in Bi2O3(PbO)âGeO2âGa2O3 (BPGG) glass doped with Tm3+ and/or Tb3+ have been investigated. It is noted that the Tm3+ single-doped BPGG glass exhibits broad 1.47-Î¼m fluorescence peaked at 1465nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of â¼134nm. The incorporation of Tb3+ into Tm3+-doped BPGG glass could significantly decrease the 1.80Î¼m emission intensity and enhance the intensity ratio of 1.47-Î¼m to 1.80-Î¼m (I 1.47/I 1.80), which reveals that Tb3+ ion can be considered to be an effective sensitizer ion on improving the 1.47-Î¼m emission. The products of FWHM Ã Ï e p e a k and Ï f Ã Ï e p e a k for the 1.47-Î¼m fluorescence are in the range of 5.66â6.63Ã10â26 cm3 and 8.76â10.02Ã10â25 cm2 s. Effects of Bi2O3 substitution for PbO on spectroscopic properties, such as 1.47-Î¼m emission of Tm3+, JuddâOfelt intensity parameters Î© t (t =2, 4, 6), and the lifetime of the 3H4 level of Tm3+, have also been investigated.",1
"Combining copper mold suction-casting and copper mold pouring-casting techniques, in-situ Ti-based bulk metallic glass matrix composites (Ti0.45Zr0.31Be0.17Cu0.07)100â x Nb x (x =4, 6, 8 and 10) with Î¦ =3mm and composites (x =6, 8 and 10) with Î¦ =8mm are fabricated in order to perform compressive and tensile tests, respectively. The volume and size of crystalline Î²-Ti(Zr, Nb) dendrites of these composites increase with the increasing Nb content, resulting in the improvement of compressive and tensile properties of the composites. Among these composites, Ti40.5Zr27.9Be15.3Cu6.3Nb10 (x =10) has the highest compressive ultimate strength of 2756MPa and plastic strain of 39.5%; meanwhile, it possesses a high tensile ultimate strength of 1428MPa and a large tensile plasticity of 7.7%. As indicated by the SEM micrographs, in compressive tests, the more branched the dendrites, the more shear bands, and the higher compressive strength and plasticity of these composites. In tensile tests of Ti40.5Zr27.9Be15.3Cu6.3Nb10 (x =10), ductile fracture features, including the macroscopic necking, fracture of ligament, vein patterns and sliding traces, are observed. The reason of the excellent mechanical properties of the measured composites is that the propagation of shear bands and cracks are impeded by Î²-Ti(Zr, Nb) dendrites, and then be confined in a small space.",0
"The thermal conductivities of binary mixed glasses, GeO2î¸SiO2 and TiO2î¸SiO2, have been measured. Two GeO2î¸SiO2 glasses measured are composed of 5 and 10 mol% of GeO2, and the one TiO2î¸SiO2 glass which was measured is composed of 5.7 mol% of TiO2. At temperatures below 1 K, the thermal conductivities of both types of mixed glasses have a T 1.8 dependence on temperature. The magnitude of the thermal conductivity of GeO2î¸SiO2 increases with increasing GeO2 concentration. The thermal conductivity of TiO2î¸SiO2 is higher than that of pure SiO2 at temperatures above 10 K but is smaller at lower temperatures. At temperature between a few K to about 20 K, the thermal conductivities of GeO2î¸SiO2 glasses have a typical plateau while that of the TiO2î¸SiO2 glass has a âshoulderâ.",1
"We studied the magnetic properties of an antiferromagnetic small particle of Ising spins. The particle is represented by a two-dimensional array of spins, where the coupling between spins in the core is antiferromagnetic, and its surface is modelled by a shell of spins with competing interactions, simulating a spin-glass type ordering at the surface. We investigated this model by mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetic behaviour was studied as a function of the temperature and external magnetic field. Some of the experimental findings observed in real antiferromagnetic nanoparticles, like hysteresis, shifted loops and coercive field, are obtained for this model. We showed that these properties strongly depend on the degree of surface disorder.",0
"Bright white light which compose of blue, green and red emission bands from Ho3+ single doped GeâGaâSâCsCl (CsBr) chalcohalide glasses under 900nm infrared laser excitation were observed and investigated. The calculated color coordinates proved that the light were close to the natural sunlight. The low phonon energy of the local surrounding of Ho3+ ions and short ultra-violet cut-off edge resulted in the strong blue emission, as well as the enhanced green and red upconversion luminescence. It was also found that color coordinates of these white lights were independent on the excitation intensity. The result indicated that Ho3+ ions singly doped chalcohalide glass can be promising candidate for white light source, 3-dimensional display or color tunable visible laser.",1
"Zr60Ti5Cu15Ni10Al10 and Zr57Ti4.75Cu14.25Ni9.5Al9.5Ta5 glass-forming alloys are investigated regarding their phase formation, as-cast microstructure, thermal stability and transformation behavior, mechanical properties and fracture features. Zr60Ti5Cu15Ni10Al10 exhibits a glass transition temperature T g of 635 K and a supercooled liquid region ÎT x of 64 K. The melt-spun glassy phase presents a two stage phase transformation sequence corresponding to glass-to-quasicrystal transformation at about 699 K and quasicrystal-to-Zr2Cu+Zr4Al3+Zr2Ni (tetragonal) transformation at about 753 K. With addition of 5 at.% Ta, T g increases to 663 K and ÎT x is reduced to 52 K. The melt-spun glassy ribbons primarily precipitates cubic-Zr2Ni upon heating to about 715â755 K. The residual glassy phase transforms into Zr3Al and Zr2Ni (tetragonal) at about 798â873 K. As-cast Zr60Ti5Cu15Ni10Al10 3 mm diameter cylinders exhibit an ultimate compression stress Ï f of 1752 MPa and Young's modulus E of 100 GPa. The 5 at.% Ta addition leads to a reduction of Ï f to 1534 MPa. None of the alloys exhibits yielding behavior or plastic deformation. Rock-layers and deformation bands are found on the fracture surface for Zr60Ti5Cu15Ni10Al10. A honeycomb-like morphology and deformation bands are also exhibited on the fracture surface of Zr57Ti4.75Cu14.25Ni9.5Al9.5Ta5. The remelting phenomenon observed for both alloys is attributed to the high strength, large elastic energy and low melting temperature of the alloys.",0
"In this work effects of the thermo-mechanical parameters were investigated in order to achieve nanocrystalline structure in the as-cast AISI 301 stainless steel. In order to get nanocrystalline structure the repetitive cold rolling and subsequent annealing were used. The cold rolling was carried out at temperatures of 0, â10 and â196 Â°C with strain rate of 0.5Â sâ1 and reduction of 95%, while the annealing treatment was conducted at temperature 600 to 850Â Â°C for 0.5 to 50Â min. The results showed that the nanocrystalline austenitic structure with grain size of about 30â40Â nm was obtained by annealing at 850Â Â°C for 0.5Â min after totally 95% cold rolling reduction at â10 Â°C.",0
"The joint of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steel and martensitic steel was produced by friction stir welding. The thermo-mechanical process during welding causes recrystallization in the ODS steel and phase transformation in the martensitic steel. In stir zones of both steels, low-angle boundaries significantly convert to high-angle boundaries. The recrystallization in ODS steel is characterized by the increase in the Î£3 twin boundary with an almost constant fraction of Î£5âÎ£29 boundaries, while the martensitic steel shows an opposite trend.",0
