Abstract,Label
"New glasses of zinc lithium borate doped with terbium oxide were synthesized by high temperature solid-state reaction. The amorphous nature of the glasses was confirmed using x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Thermoluminescence (TL) response of pure zinc lithium borate (ZLB) and zinc lithium borate doped with terbium (ZLB: Tb) exposed to gamma radiation was measured and compared. There is significant enhancement in the TL yields of ZLB: Tb compared to that of pure ZLB. Effect of varying concentration of dopant (Tb4O7) on the TL response of zinc lithium borate was investigated. 0.3mol% concentration of Tb exhibited strongest TL intensity. Thermoluminescence curve of the phosphor consist of single isolated peak. The TL response of the new materials to the exposed radiation is linear within 0.5â100Gy range of dose with sublinearity at the lower region of the curve. High sensitivity was exhibited by the new amorphous materials. Reproducibility, thermal fading and energy response of the proposed TLD were investigated and shows remarkable result that made the phosphor suitable for radiation dosimetry.",1
"This paper reports on the optical spectroscopic properties and thermal stability of Er3+-doped antimony-borosilicate glasses for developing 1.5Î¼m optical amplifiers. Upon excitation at 980nm laser diode, an intense 1.5Î¼m infrared fluorescence has been observed with the maximum full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 90nm for Er3+-doped antimony-borosilicate glasses. The emission cross-section and the lifetime of the 4 I 13/2 level of Er3+ ions are 6.3Ã10â21 cm2 and 0.30ms, respectively. It is noted that the product of the emission cross-section and FWHM of the glass studied is as great as 567Ã10â21 cm2 nm, which is comparable or higher than that of bismuthate and tellurite glasses.",1
"Introduction of shear bands in metallic glasses is usually regarded as being responsible for softening metallic glasses. Here we present that hardness of deformed Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 bulk metallic glass (BMG) exhibits an initial decrease and a subsequent increase with plastic strain. This extraordinary variation of hardness was studied by investigating evolution of shear band intersections and free volume with plastic strain. As plastic strain increases from 6% to 83%, the density of shear bands increases from 0.04 to 0.92Â Î¼mâ1. Meanwhile, the distribution width of shear band spacings gradually narrows, and the number of intersections between shear bands increases. When plastic strain is larger than 47%, the number of intersections increases faster. Free volume in the deformed BMG at room temperature increases with plastic strain increasing from 6% to 83%. Both free volume induced softening and shear band interaction induced hardening may affect the hardness of the deformed BMG. In the plastic strain range of 0%â47%, free volume induced softening mainly contributes to the initial decrease in hardness with plastic strain. In the plastic strain range of 47%â83%, shear band interaction induced hardening may lead to the increase in hardness with plastic strain, after counteracting free volume induced softening.",0
"Nd3+/Ho3+/Yb3+ triply doped TeO2âK2OâNb2O5 glasses were synthesized by the conventional melting-quenching technique. Single green upconversion (UC) luminescence centered at 532nm, corresponding to the (5F4, 5S2)â5I8 transitions of Ho3+, was observed under 800nm excitation. However, green and red emission bands centered at 547, 662 and 758nm, corresponding to the (5F4, 5S2)â5I8, 5F5â5I8 and (5F4, 5S2)â5I7 transitions of Ho3+, respectively, were simultaneously observed under 980nm excitation. The dependence of UC luminescence intensity of Ho3+ under 800 and 980nm excitations on Yb3+ concentration was studied. It was found, under 800nm excitation, the 532nm emission intensity of Ho3+ begin to reduce when the Yb3+ concentration is higher than 0.8mol%. However, at the same concentration of Yb3+, the emission quenching was not observed under 980nm excitation. The UC mechanisms under two pumping sources were discussed in terms of the experiment results. It was found that the UC luminescence of Ho3+ mainly depends on ET under 800nm excitation; however under 980nm excitation, it mainly depends on ESA.",1
"The bond strength of a glass polyalkenoate cement after chemomechanical caries removal of dentine with or without the use of a conditioning agent and the mode of bond failure using scanning electron microscopy was examined. Forty extracted carious human teeth were divided into four groups of ten. Conventional caries removal was carried out on two groups and chemomechanical caries removal on the other two groups. Surface conditioner was applied to the dentine in one conventionally treated and one chemomechanically treated group. Glass polyalkenoate cement was applied via a metal holder to the dentine. The samples were stored for 7 days in a moist environment at 37Â°C. The samples were subjected to a shearing-type stress at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm minâ1. The mean bond strength for each group, in MPa (standard deviation), was: conventional caries removal alone 1.32 (0.51), conventional caries removal and conditioner application 2.43 (0.47), chemomechanical caries removal alone 2.47 (0.99) and chemomechanical caries removal and conditioner application 2.76 (0.96). Mean bond strengths for both the chemomechanically treated groups and the conventionally treated group, coupled with the use of the conditioning agent, were significantly greater than for the conventionally treated groups alone at the 0.05 level. There was no significant difference between the chemomechanically treated groups or the group conventionally treated with conditioner application. SEM examination revealed a combination of cohesive and adhesive bond failure. Different morphologies between the conventionally and chemomechanically treated surfaces were also evident.",0
"The impact resistance of fibre-reinforced composites is vital in many applications, and can be improved by exploiting synergies in fibre-hybridisation. These effects are however not sufficiently well understood in the literature. Penetration impact tests were hence performed on carbon/glass hybrids, and the results were linked to the flexural behaviour and translaminar fracture toughness. The results revealed large synergetic effects of up to 40% compared to the linear rule-of-mixtures. The results are also the first to reveal that creating a translaminar fracture surface can strongly contribute to the energy absorbed during penetration impact: 56% for an all-carbon fibre composite and 13% for an all-glass fibre composite. These results prove that strategies for maximising the translaminar fracture toughness can also be exploited to maximise the penetration impact resistance of fibre-hybrids. In carbon fibre composites in particular, ply blocking, using larger yarns and introducing micro-cuts should therefore increase the penetration impact resistance.",0
"A Mgâ6Gdâ1Znâ0.6Zr alloy has been hot rolled, and the recrystallisation and texture development examined. During recrystallisation it was observed that the recrystallisation caused dissolution of the Î³â² particles that had developed during hot rolling. These coherent particles provided significant Zener pinning, and resulted in relatively slow recrystallisation kinetics. The texture of the recrystallised grains after hot rolling was weak, and this weak texture persisted into the fully recrystallised condition. It is concluded that the weak textures that develop in this alloy are due to the dominance of oriented nucleation of recrystallised grains at the prior grain boundaries during hot rolling and subsequent annealing.",0
"In this paper structural and optical properties of Rare Earth doped (RE) gallo-germanate glasses modified with various amount of Al2O3 have been investigated. Glasses doped with Yb3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+ ions were synthesized to study Al2O3 additive influence on their structural and emission properties in the visible spectral region. MIR spectra indicated that the structure of prepared glasses tends to order and its polymerization along with the aluminum content increase. Glass samples consisting of the low molar content of Al2O3 are characterized by a significant contribution of Tm3+ ions in light emission while Ho3+ ions luminescence dominates in samples consisting of the higher molar content of Al2O3. Additionally, investigation of light emission in visible range showed that samples consisting of the low molar content of Al2O3 are characterized by greenish blue light emission whereas light emitted by samples consisting of 15â20â¯mol% is much closer to the white colour.",1
"The tensile properties of cement composites containing polypropylene networks alone and also hybrids of polypropylene and continuons glass or carbon fibres, were compared after curing at 20 Â°C or 170 Â°C in an autoclave. Although 170 Â°C is nominally above the melting temperature of polypropylene, the fibres maintained a high proportion of their properties on cooling. Hybrids of carbon and polypropylene also survived autoclaving but the continuous glass fibres suffered severe damage in this curing regime.",0
"AC and dc magnetic susceptibility measurements have been carried out after annealing under an appropriate condition for Y6(Mn1âx Fe x )23 compounds with x=0.50, 0.55 and 0.60. At low temperatures, the onset of a spinâglass state has been confirmed in contrast with the existing data. It is concluded that the blocking of antiferromagnetic clusters claimed in previous studies is attributed to compositional inhomogeneity.",0
"By tuning the composition and melt cooling rate, in situ composites of bulk metallic glass (BMG) with primary phase of B2-type AgMg compound can be fabricated in MgâCuâAgâY quaternary systems. In the composite, volume fraction of AgMg dendrites dispersed in the glass matrix varies in a range of 20â40%. In contrast to monolithic BMG, Mg52.8Cu19.9Ag19.5Y7.8 composite with AgMg of 40vol.% dendrites manifest a distinct improvement in the compressive yield strength (~1040MPa), fracture strength (1.2GPa) and plastic strain (0.4â2%), as well as an apparent work-hardening effect. Moreover, AgMg phase in the composite plays a significant role to suppress the crack propagation, then enhancing the fracture toughness, as indicated by an increment of notch toughness (K Q) from ~6MPa m1/2 of monolithic BMG to ~8MPa m1/2 of the composite. However, since the tiny plastic zone size of glassy matrix is unable to match the microstructural length scales, improvement in the ductility and toughness of Mg-based BMG in situ composite remains limited.",0
"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the compound effects of diatomite and glass fiber on asphalt mixture. The diatomite and glass fiber compound modified asphalt mixture (DGFMAM) was prepared in laboratory. Performances of DGFMAM were investigated by experimental method. Wheel tracking test, low temperature indirect tensile test, indirect tensile fatigue test (ITFT) and indirect tensile stiffness modulus test (ITSM) were carried out. The statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) method and statistical regression method were used to evaluate the effects of diatomite and glass fiber on properties of asphalt mixture. Results indicate that diatomite and glass fiber improve the rutting resistance and fatigue properties of control asphalt mixture. Diatomite has a significant effect on the stiffness modulus of asphalt mixture. Disadvantage of diatomite on low temperature deformation property of asphalt mixture is solved by glass fiber. DGFMAM has better travelling performances than the control mixture. It will provide a reference for the design of compound modified asphalt mixture.",0
"The present study describes the synthesis of nanocrystalline equiatomic CuNiCoZnAlTi high entropy alloy by mechanical alloying and characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM. The CuNiCoZnAlTi high entropy alloy is mainly composed of BCC solid solution with crystallite size less than 10nm in as milled condition. The alloy is thermally stable at elevated temperature about 800Â°C as it retained its nanostructure. This alloy powder was consolidated using vacuum hot press at 800Â°C with 30MPa pressure to a density of 99.95%. The hardness and compressive strength of the high entropy alloy are found to be 7.55 and 2.36GPa, respectively. Superior strength of high entropy alloy is attributed to solid solution strengthening and its nanocrystalline nature.",0
"The results of a detailed molecular-dynamics investigation of relaxation in the van der Waals system o-terphenyl are presented. Our calculations give evidence for the existence of a fast process on the picosecond timescale. This confirms the neutron-scattering observation of an anomalous decrease of the Debye-Waller factor, predicted by mode-coupling theory, and reconciles it with the temperature-independent process with a 3 ps relaxation time observed in light-scattering experiments. We demonstrate that this process results from the strongly anharmonic motion of molecules trapped in the cages formed by their neighbours.",0
"Nanocrystalline TiCâZrC solid solutions (Ti x Zr1âx C1âÎ´ ) with densification of ~100% have been successfully prepared by spark plasma sintering. Due to the difference in ionic radii of Ti and Zr, the required sintering temperature for single-phase solid solutions exhibits an asymmetric dependence on x, being highest at x=0.7. At a temperature lower than the consolute one, the two-phase solid solution is formed, exhibiting the ability of grain size refinements to nanoscale. Due to the alternate reinforcements and the grain size refinements in TiCâZrC solid solutions, the mechanical properties of Vickers hardness and fracture toughness are significantly increased when compared to TiC and ZrC.",0
"In this work, the near-infrared photoluminescence properties in Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped tellurite glass was investigated. The tellurite glass with composition TeO2-ZnO-Na2O-La2O3 was synthesized using conventional melt-quenching technique and characterized by UV/Vis/NIR absorption and near-infrared emission spectroscopies, fluorescence decay measurement and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis. Under the excitation of 808nm laser diode (LD), a broadband 2.0Î¼m band luminescence ranging from 1600 to 2200nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 362nm was observed, which was contributed by 1.85Î¼m fluorescence from Tm3+: 3F4 â 3H6 and 2.05Î¼m fluorescence from Ho3+: 5I7 â 5I8. The fluorescence emission of Ho3+ was originated from the energy transfer from Tm3+ to Ho3+ ions, and the energy transfer mechanism was elucidated by analyzing fluorescence decay behavior of Tm3+ and quantitative calculation of phonon contribution joined in the energy transfer process. Meanwhile, based on the absorption spectrum, some important spectroscopic parameters such as Judd-Ofelt intensity parameter, spontaneous radiative transition probability, fluorescence branching ratio, absorption and emission cross-sections, and gain coefficient spectrum were calculated to reveal the spectroscopic properties of doped tellurite glass. Furthermore, from the DSC curve it can be derived that the investigated glass possesses a good thermal stability with ÎT(= T x â T g) larger than 152Â°C. These results indicate that Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped tellurite glass could be a promising gain medium applied for 2.0Î¼m near-infrared band broad fiber amplifiers and tunable fiber lasers.",1
"Using a mixed classical Molecular dynamics (MD)/ab initio simulation scheme combined with a quasi-harmonic approximation, we calculate the linear thermal expansion coefficient Î± L(T) in vitreous silica glasses. The systems are first cooled down by classical MD simulations. Then they are structurally relaxed by ab initio DFT calculations. The vibrational properties are calculated employing the frozen phonon method, and these results are finally used to calculate the Helmholtz free energy as a function of volume. In agreement with experiments, our simulations predict that Î± L(T) is negative at low temperatures up to T â 150 K. In this low-temperature regime, the simulation results are in quantitative agreement with experiments. To elucidate the origin of the negative thermal expansion, we analyze in detail the microscopic mode GrÃ¼neisen parameters in the system and show that the anomalous behavior of Î± L(T) can be related to the fact that the GrÃ¼neisen parameters for the lowest modes become negative at low temperatures â i.e., the lowest eigenfrequencies become stiffer with increasing volume.",1
"Two different microstructures, i.e., fine-grained solute depleted (FGSD) and coarse-grained solute enriched (CGSE), are prepared by thermomechanical processing. The samples are subjected to six pass equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). EBSD indicates formation of an ultrafine grained (UFG) structure within a size range of 632nm in FGSD in comparison to 727nm in CGSE which is attributed to more significant grain fragmentation in the FGSD sample with higher surface area of boundaries. In both as-annealed and -deformed conditions, hardness, yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the CGSE samples are higher than those of FGSD which is attributed to more significant solute enrichment. Elongation is found to reduce by the initial passes of ECAP and gradually improve by further processing. At a similar deformation history, the uniform elongation of the deformed CGSE samples is higher than those of the deformed FGSD samples which is attributed to more significant solute enrichment and work hardening causing a delayed necking and larger uniform elongation. However, the elongation to failure of FGSD samples after 2, 4 or 6 pass ECAP is larger than the CGSE sample with a similar deformation history which may be due to the high capacity of boundaries to accommodate dislocations and postpone fracture.",0
"Phosphate glasses having the general formula (100-x) NaPO3-x SrO with an O/P ratio varying between 3 and 3.25 were synthesized by melt quenching technique. The glasses are studied in order to determine the influence of SrO addition on the structural and physical-chemical properties. Density, glass transition and crystallization temperatures increase with SrO content, showing the shrinking and reticulation of phosphate network. The chemical durability of the glass series is enhanced by the substitution of Na2O and P2O5 by SrO. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and 31P Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopies revealed the depolymerisation of the glass network by the decrease of middle chain units to create end chain units species. Calorimetric study of the dissolution of glasses in acid solution shows a decrease of the dissolution enthalpy when the SrO is added.",1
"In anticipation of using fluctuations in the nuclear dipolar and quadrupolar interaction as a probe of lithium ion motion in lithium borate glasses, the static values of these interactions were measured using a variety of echo techniques. The static quadrupolar echo spectrum of 7Li and a calculation of the dipolar interaction in crystalline Li2B4O7 (same chemical composition as the glass under study) were used to estimate the strength of the two interactions. These indicate that the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for 6Li will be of similar size and the dipolar interaction will be dominated by the unlike spin interaction between the 6Li and the 10B, 11B spins. An appropriate theoretical model is proposed and explicit expressions for the echo amplitude are calculated in terms of the dipolar and quadrupolar second moments. This single spin model takes into account the quadrupolar interaction but treats the dipolar interaction as an effective magnetic field. Experimental results are presented which show the essential validity of the model and measurements lead to reasonable values for the dipolar and quadrupolar second moments. The relative merits of the various echo techniques are discussed.",1
"Amorphous alloys Cu50Pr30Ni10Al10â2x Ti x B x (x =0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.16at.%) have been obtained by melt-spinning technology. Results show that Cu50Pr30Ni10Al9.9Ti0.05B0.05 melt-spun ribbon at a surface velocity of 38.5m/s is fully amorphous, while partial amorphous structure can be obtained with further additions. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analyses indicate that minor addition of 0.05% Ti and 0.05% B can improve the thermal stability of melt-spun amorphous alloys, while further additions show reverse influence. The effects of Ti and B are that minor addition increases the tendency of new phases formation, and appropriate addition can suppress the formation of crystalline phases.",0
"This paper focuses on the effect of hydrated lime on the linear viscoelastic (LVE) properties of asphalt mixtures with glass aggregates subjected to conditioning: 1) 14â¯days in hot water and 2) repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Complex modulus test was used to evaluate LVE properties. Three glass aggregates (0%, 20%, 60%) and two hydrated lime (0%, 2%) content were studied. Results show LVE properties of samples with glass aggregates (0% hydrated lime) are greatly affected by conditioning. Adding hydrated lime to samples with glass aggregates significantly reduce the variation of LVE properties due to conditioning.",0
"Hybridization of natural/glass fiber reinforced polymer composites has been developing to build their applications in the field of engineering and technology. Present study deals with recent developments of natural fiber reinforced polymer hybrid composites made by hand lay-up and compression molding techniques. This investigation is to understand an outline of the results presented on the incorporation of natural fiber with glass fiber reinforced polymer composites. It focuses the attention in terms of physical and mechanical characteristics of hybrid composites and related studies have cited. Hybrid composites made of two different natural fibers with glass fiber are less widespread comparable to natural/glass fiber, yet it prompts grow the applications.",0
"This paper presents the effects of elevated in-service temperature on the flexural behavior of sandwich composites consisting of glass-fiber-reinforced-polymer (GFRP) skins and a phenolic core. The glass transition temperatures of the GFRP skin and phenolic core were obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Subsequently, the flexural behavior of the GFRP skin and the sandwich beams were assessed with a 3-point static bending test at temperatures ranging from room temperature up to 180Â°C. The results show that the variation trend of the GFRP skinâs stiffness from 3-point static bending test is in general agreement with the corresponding storage modulus results from the DMA. The GFRP skin, phenolic core, and sandwich beams retained more than 80% of their mechanical properties at 80Â°C. Moreover, the flexural behavior of the sandwich beams was governed by the GFRP skins up to 80Â°C, while the phenolic core played a major part on overall behavior beyond this temperature. The full-composite action between the skin and core was lost due to the disintegration of the phenolic core at high temperature.",0
"Since Pr3+ ion has various emission bands in the visible region, Pr3+-doped materials are expected to be a potential candidate as laser media. In the present study, sulfide halide glasses based on Ga2S3âGeS2âCsX (X=Cl, Br), containing 20mol% or more of CsX, and doped with Pr3+, were prepared for investigation of the visible spectroscopic properties of these glasses. The absorption edges were located around 460nm and various emission bands in the visible region were observed with 450nm excitation. JuddâOfelt analyses were performed and total radiative transition rates from the 3P j levels of Pr3+ were estimated. The lifetime of the decay was approximately 10Î¼s for the emission at 654nm due to the 3P0â3F2 transition. The emission quantum efficiencies were estimated from the ratio of the emission lifetime to the radiative transition lifetime calculated with the JuddâOfelt analyses. The large efficiencies were attributed to the low phonon energies of the glass matrices compared with the energy gap between the 3P0 and the next lower level.",1
"Five different poly(amic dialkyl ester) precursors with various chain rigidities were synthesized and their powder and film samples were prepared in residual solvent free: poly(4,4â²-oxydiphenylene biphenyltetracarboxamic diethyl ester); poly(p-phenylene biphenyltetracarboxamic diethyl ester); poly(p-phenylene biphenyltetracarboxamic dimethyl ester); poly(4,4â²-oxydiphenylene pyromellitamic diethyl ester); and poly(p-phenylene pyromellitamic diethyl ester). Glass transition temperatures (T gs) of these precursors, which have never been reported so far, were successfully determined in the present study by the new oscillating differential scanning calorimetry (o.d.s.c.). In addition, their imidization behaviours and morphological structures were investigated by o.d.s.c. and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The measured T gs are in the range 179.2â235.4Â°C, depending upon the precursor backbone structure as well as the history of sample preparation: these T gs are very close to the imidization temperatures (T is), causing difficulties in the T g measurements. The measured T is are in the range 198.1â235.4Â°C, depending upon the precursor backbone structure as well as the history of sample preparation. The T gs are dependent on the chain rigidity and the morphological structure, whereas the T is are influenced by the chemical nature in addition to the chain rigidity and the morphological structure.",0
"The hot hardness of Si3N4 tool materials of the CeO2 and CeO2î¸AIN doping systems, oxidation in air from 900 to 1450 Â°C, and turning of tool steel with ceramic inserts of the same compositions were investigated to determine the effect of the N content of intergranular phase. Si/N grain boundary diffusion was found to be the main controlling mechanism at high temperature for densification, mechanical behavior and chemical degradation of these materials in air, the passivation oxidation rate of the CeO2î¸AINî¸Si3N4 system being dependent on the atomic fraction of N of the intergranular phase, with lower values for the N-rich compositions.",0
"The tellurite fibers based on glasses with the composition TeO2âWO3âNb2O5âNa2OâAl2O3âEr2O3âYb2O3 were fabricated by the rod-in-tube technique using a Heathway drawing tower. The upconversion luminescence of Er3+/Yb3+ codoped tellurite glass fibers under 980nm excitation were investigated. The Er3+/Yb3+co-doped tellurite fibers show an efficient up-conversion process in comparison with the Er3+-doped tellurite fibers. The pump power dependent intensities were discussed, which showed that two photons are involved in the upconversion process.",1
"Glasses with compositions of 34.5SiO2â25AlPO4â12.5Al2O3â12.5B2O3â15R2Oâ0.5Bi2O3 (R =Li, Na, K) were synthesized. Characteristic absorption bands of bismuth centered at 500, 700, and 800nm and broadband near infrared (NIR) emissions peaked at 1100 and 1300nm were observed. With the change of alkali ion (Li+ âNa+ âK+), the intensity of absorption bands at 500 and 800nm increase, while the intensity of two NIR emissions decrease. The dependence of NIR emission peaked at 1300nm on the radius of the alkali ion is found to be opposite to that in previous reports, being ascribed to the abnormal reduction of Bi ion in the glasses investigated herein. The results of this work is helpful for understanding the nature of Bi-NIR-emission, and the NIR emission peaked at 1300nm was proposed to originate from Bi+ according to the influence of the alkali ions sizes.",1
"Glass formation range, glass-forming ability and crystallization kinetics were studied with alkali-containing fluoride systems of compositions (100-x)(0.6ZrF4Â·0.1AlF3Â·0.3BaF2)-xLi(Na, K or Cs)F. Glass formation range decreases with increasing size of alkali ion. Maximum of glass-forming ability is found around the alkali fluoride (RF) concentration of 5â20 mol%. The composition corresponding to the maximum shifts to lower RF concentrations with increasing size of alkali ion. The glass-forming ability appears to be mainly determined by the difference between crystallization and glass transition temperatures. Crystallization kinetics study shows that the maximum of glass-forming ability corresponds to a minimum of the activation energy of crystallization for glasses containing LiF.",1
We successfully welded 3mm thick Zr41Be23Ti14Cu12Ni10 bulk metallic glass plate to Ti metal by electron beam welding with a beam irradiated 0.4mm on the BMG side of the interface. There was no crystallization or defects in the weld because changes in the chemical composition of the weld metal were prevented. Bending showed that the welded sample had a higher strength than the Ti base metal. The interface had a 10Î¼m thick interdiffusion layer of Zr and Ti.,0
"Although there are many procedures of analyzing a material, this paper deals with TGA and DSC analysis processes. The purpose of TGA and DSC analyses are to determine physical properties of respective materials. TGA or Thermogravimetric analysis is done for determining the change in physical and chemical properties. Although both of TGA and DSC analyses deal with temperature, TGA analysis provides supplementary and complementary information regarding DSC analysis. In TGA analysis, the change of properties is function of temperature with heating rate as constant or as a function of time with constant temperature (and/or constant mass loss). It provides information about physical phenomena, such as second-order phase transitions, along with characteristics like desorption, sublimation, absorption, and vaporization. DSC analysis is that the difference in the amount of heatrequired to increase temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. TGA provides information regarding physical properties such as vaporization, sublimation, absorption, adsorption and chemical properties like chemisorptions, desolvation, decomposition. Similarly DSC analysis provides information regarding Transition temperatures, glass transitions, Polymorphic transformation.",0
"The plain concrete has been replaced by fiber reinforced concrete from past years. The inclusion of fibers in the concrete decrease the brittleness and advances the mechanical properties. This paper evaluates the properties of vibrated concrete and self-compacting concrete reinforced with steel fiber and glass fiber. In this study, the self-compacting concrete and vibrated concrete were tested with varying fiber content of steel fibers (0.3, 0.6 and 0.9%) and glass fibers (0.02, 0.03 and 0.04%). For this purpose, vibrated concrete and self-compacting concrete were designed. The fresh batches of vibrated concrete were assessed for slump and the fresh batches of self-compacting concrete were assessed for slump flow, T500 and V-funnel (TV). The surface hardness and homogeneity of the concrete were inspected for all the mixes and 28â¯days compressive strength test, split tensile strength test and flexural strength test were carried. The experimental results indicated that the workability was highly influenced by fibers in the concrete irrespective to type of fiber. The steel fibers improved the flexural strength, split tensile strength and had slight effect on compressive values. The glass fibers increased the compressive strength effectively than steel fibers. The homogeneity was observed excellent and reduced with increased fiber volume and surface hardness increased with fibers. The properties of self-compacting concrete were highly influenced by the fibers than the properties of vibrated concrete.",0
"Selected heavy metal glasses containing Yb3+ and Er3+ ions have been studied. Near-infrared luminescence spectra at 1.53Î¼m and up-conversion spectra of Er3+ ions were registered under excitation of Yb3+ ions by 975nm diode laser line. The luminescence bands correspond to 4I13/2â4I15/2 (NIR), 4S3/2â4I15/2 (green) and 4F9/2â4I15/2 (red) transitions of Er3+, respectively. The optical transitions of rare earth ions have been examined as a function of glass host. The unusual large spectral linewidth nearly close to 110nm for 4I13/2â4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions in YbâEr co-doped lead borate glass was obtained, whereas long-lived NIR luminescence at 1.53Î¼m was detected in lead germanate glass. The NIR luminescence and up-conversion phenomena strongly depend on stretching vibrations of glass host, which was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy.",1
"Three Ti-based metallic glass matrix composites (MGMCs) with different sizes of dendrites exhibit excellent mechanical properties. Different sizes of dendrites lead to different tensile properties, the size of dendrites plays an important role in gaining the tensile ductility of the in situ MGMCs. The dependences of the ductility and the size of the dendrites in the in situ MGMCs can be illustrated by an inverted U-shaped curves. The tensile deformation behavior of the present composites is classified into three stages, each stage and effects of the changed sizes of dendrites are investigated by focusing on the evolution of dislocations in dendrites and shear bands in amorphous matrix.",0
"Statement of problem. The ultimate goal of any denture repair is to restore the original strength of the denture and to avoid further fracture. Purpose. This study investigated the strength and deflection of repaired acrylic resin joints reinforced with various glass fiber concentrations. Material And Methods. Transverse strength, maximum deflection, and modulus of elasticity of glass fiber-reinforced polymethyl methacrylate acrylic resin were studied with a 3-point load test on 54 intact specimens. Six concentrations of type B glass fiber specimens were prepared (n = 9 per each fiber group). Fractured joint margins were rounded, a 2-mm gap was placed between them, and then they were repaired with autopolymerizing acrylic resin and retested. Results. Transverse strength, maximum deflection, and the stiffness of all joints were significantly lower after the repair. Among the groups tested, the units treated with 1% glass fiber displayed the highest transverse strength before and after repair. Modulus of elasticity of the repaired 1% fiber concentration units was enhanced by approximately 25% over those repaired but untreated with glass fiber (0% fiber).

"Î³-TiAl alloy was successfully welded using pure Ti filler metal by laser. The microstructures, element distribution and phase composition of the joint were investigated by SEM, EDS and XRD, and the mechanical properties of the joints were evaluated by nanoindentation and tensile strength tests. Crack-free joints were obtained by using Ti filler metal. The weld zone mainly contained of Î±2-Ti3Al phase and a small amount of Ti2Al phases. The hardness values in the weld zone were higher than that of base metal (BM) due to the formation of Î±2-Ti3Al phase, but for the modulus values were just the reverse. The tensile strength and elongation of the joints were 288MPa and 2.19%, respectively, accounting for 74.8% and 94.0% of the BM, respectively. The joint fracture surface exhibited typical brittle fracture morphology, and Ti2Al and TiAl2 particle phases can be seen on the fracture surface.",0
"A random, quantum model of interacting spins, where the spin operators are represented by bilinear combinations of fermions, is studied in the Ising limit and in the static approximation. Assuming replica symmetry we recover basically the results of Sherrington and Kirkpatrick. Effects of quantum fluctuations remain in the determination of the static susceptibility Ï as an independent order parameter and the breakdown of the Fischer relation.",0
"A series of bismuth phosphate (BiP) glasses activated with 0.5â¯mol% of Dy3+ and different concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0â¯mol%) of Sm3+ ions were prepared by melt quenching technique. These are characterized through optical absorption, photoluminescence and decay measurements for spectroscopic investigations. The luminescence spectra have been studied under selected excitation wavelengths to examine the energy transfer mechanism in the present Dy3+-Sm3+ co-doped glass by varying Sm3+ ion concentration. The lifetimes of both 4F9/2 level of Dy3+ ion and 4G5/2 level of Sm3+ ion of co-doped glasses have obtained and found to be decreased with increase in Sm3+ ion concentration. The emission intensity increased with the increase of Sm3+ ion concentration (upto 1.5â¯mol%) which confirms the energy transfer process between Dy3+ to Sm3+ ions. The CIE chromaticity co-ordinates (x, y), correlated color temperature (CCT) and color purity (CP) were determined from the emission data. From the CIE, CCT and CP values, it can be concluded that there is a color hue from neutral to warm white light region due to Sm3+ ion concentration and selected excitation wavelength. Hence, the obtained results strongly suggest that the present Dy3+-Sm3+ co-doped bismuth phosphate glasses could be useful for lighting applications.",1

"The effect of B to P concentration ratio on the glass-forming ability (GFA) and soft-magnetic properties of [(Fe0.5Ni0.5)0.78B0.22âx P x ]97Nb3 (x =0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.09) glassy alloys was investigated. By adjusting the concentration ratio of B to P, GFA and soft-magnetic properties are effectively improved. Bulk glassy alloys (BGAs) with diameters up to 1.5mm were synthesized in the composition range of x =0.03â0.07. In addition to high GFA, the FeNi-based glassy alloys exhibit excellent soft-magnetic properties, i.e., rather low H c of 0.7â0.95A/m, high Î¼ e of 17,200â24,300 and high saturation magnetization of 0.63â0.82T. The [(Fe0.5Ni0.5)0.78B0.17P0.05]97Nb3 BGA exhibits high hardness of 890kg/mm2. The improvement of GFA and soft-magnetic properties are derived from the enhanced atomic bonding nature and phase competing process in conjugation with precipitation of (Fe, Ni)23B6 phase with complex structure.",0
"Heterogeneous nucleation of Î±-Al and other phases was investigated in an Al70Ni13Si17 (in at.%) alloy, using a novel metallic glass technique. The glass was formed by melt spinning and its devitrification/crystallisation behaviour during isothermal and anisothermal anneals was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry. The results obtained indicated suitability of the above alloy system for the nucleation study. TiB2 grain refiner particles were subsequently added to the melt and the melt-spun ribbons produced were examined using transmission electron microscopy. No Î±-Al nucleation was detected on the boride particles, while it was systematically observed on hexagonal dendrites present in the glassy matrix, which suggests that Si poisoning of the borides is occurring. The high Si content appears to suppress the formation of Al3Ti layers on the surface of TiB2 particles, thus reducing their potency to nucleate Î±-Al.",0
"This study aims to investigate the low-velocity impact response and post-impact flexural behaviour of glass/polyamide-6 (G/PA-6) composite. G/PA-6 composites with a layup configuration of [02,902]s were prepared via press-forming technique. Composite samples were developed using four different processing conditions, by modifying compression pressure and heating temperature. Local variations of fiber volume and porosity fraction were noticed for samples developed in each processing conditions. On the investigated samples, damages were induced by using 35 joule of drop weight impact to investigate the impact resistance of samples with respect to different processing conditions. The damage behaviour and residual flexural strength was characterized using a micro-CT and three-point bending tests respectively. Furthermore, the influence of porosity fraction on the residual flexural strength were investigated. This paper will provide necessary fundamental knowledge for future selection of processing parameters in order to have enhanced impact performance.",0
"The screening dependence investigations of the superconducting state parameters (SSP) viz., electronâphonon coupling strength Î», Coulomb pseudopotential Î¼ â, transition temperature T C, isotope effect exponent Î± and effective interaction strength N O V of 10 binary Cu x Zr100âx (x =0.25, 0.30, 0.33, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.57 and 0.60) metallic glasses have been reported using Ashcroftâs empty core (EMC) model potential. Five local field correction functions proposed by Hartree (H), Taylor (T), IchimaruâUtsumi (IU), Farid et al. (F) and Sarkar et al. (S) are used in the present investigation to study the screening influence on the aforesaid properties. It is observed that the electronâphonon coupling strength Î» and the transition temperature T C are quite sensitive to the selection of the local field correction functions, whereas, the Coulomb pseudopotential Î¼ â, isotope effect exponent Î± and effective interaction strength N O V show weak dependences on the local field correction functions. The T C obtained from IU-local field correction function are found an excellent agreement with available theoretical or experimental data and show almost linear nature with the concentration âxâ of Cu element. A linear T C equation is proposed by fitting the present outcomes for IU-local field correction function, which is in conformity with other results for the experimental data. Also, the present results are found in qualitative agreement with other such earlier reported data, which confirms the superconducting phase in the metallic glasses.",0
"Motivated by potential application for neutron detection, novel Ce3+-activated Li2OâB2O3âGd2O3 scintillating glasses containing neutron-capture elements were synthesized by melt-quenching method. The energy transfer from the host glass to Gd3+ and Ce3+ ions, as well as from Gd3+ to Ce3+ ions are confirmed by VUVâUV spectra. The strongest emission intensity of Ce3+ ions with about 29ns is obtained when the scintillating glass contains a fraction of 0.25mol% CeF3, whose mean distance is estimated to be about 25.63Ã .",1
"The ~1.8Î¼m emission characteristics of Tm3+ by a direct excitation and through an energy transfer process upon sensitization with Yb3+ ions in tellurite glass are reported. The spectroscopic properties of Tm3+ ions have been evaluated by applying JuddâOfelt theory on the measured absorption spectrum. The obtained intensity parameters, Î© 2=7.155Ã10â20 cm2, Î© 4=3.325Ã10â20 cm2, Î© 6=1.278Ã10â20 cm2 are used to estimate the radiative properties of Tm3+ ions in the present glass host. A ~10 fold enhancement in the Tm3+ 1.8Î¼m emission observed with 16 fold reduced emission of Yb3+ ions (1008nm) in co-doped sample on Yb3+ ions excitation illustrates the efficient energy transfer from Yb3+: 2F5/2âTm3+: 3H5. The energy transfer process assisted by host phonon energy has been discussed by using relevant theoretical models and estimated the energy transfer micro-parameters. Effect of energy back transfer Tm3+âYb3+ on NIR and upconversion emissions have been discussed. An efficient ~1.8Î¼m with comparatively higher emission cross-section 1.115Ã10â20 cm2 on account of reduced upconversion emissions has been achieved in the present tellurite glass.",1
"This study presents a new approach method for instrumented drop weight tests, with a central spherical impactor and a circular sample support. The tests were carried out on glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates with three types of reinforcement: plain-woven fabric, stitched plain-woven fabric and 3D non-crimp fabric (NCF). It was found that the plain-woven fabric reinforced laminate showed a more violent destruction mode (a massive fracture crack) in comparison with the other two. The stitched and the 3D NCF reinforced laminates exhibited a better impact resistance manifested by a higher stress at the failure initiation point, and a slower or totally arrested fracture crack growth. The applied methodology proved effective for the evaluation of materials under impact loading conditions. A novel element is the use of fast-frame camera images to measure the displacement of the specimens during the impact. It strongly improved the obtained results and enabled a reliable analysis of the strain-stress progress.",0

The observed transformation of the confinement-related features in the spectra is related to irradiation-induced negative ionization of the nanocrystals with charge transfer across the nanocrystal/matrix interface. The dependence of the radiation-induced changes on the nanocrystal size and composition is discussed.",1
"A detailed investigation on 1.06Â Î¼m spectroscopic properties as a function of Nd3+ ions concentration in bismuth silicate glasses is reported. JuddâOfelt analysis indicated that Nd2O3 has no substantial influence on glass structure. Based on the JuddâOfelt intensity parameters, several radiative properties such as radiative transition probability, radiative lifetime, branching ratio and emission cross-section of Nd3+ ions have been derived. The 1.06Â Î¼m emission intensity increases firstly and then attains maximum at 0.5Â mol% Nd2O3 and decreases with further increase of dopant concentration. The luminescence quenching behavior at higher Nd3+ concentration has been ascribed to the hopping migration assisted cross relaxation mechanism. The high emission cross section (2.33Â ÃÂ 10â20Â cm2) and large quantum efficiency (90.7%) suggests their potential for compact 1.06Â Î¼m lasers applications.",1
"The magnetic properties of the semimagnetic semiconductor CdFe1âx Sb x (X = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9) have been investigated experimentally using a.c.-susceptibility (X a.c.), magnetization and MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopic techniques. All samples exhibit sharp cusps at the freezing temperatures T Æ in X a.c. â T data resembling those of spin-glasses. The observation of MÃ¶ssbauer spectra consisting of a quadrupole doublet superimposed on Zeeman split pattern and finite magnetic moments for X = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 suggest that these materials behave like âferromagnetic cluster spin-glassâ, while for X = 0.9 due to the least Fe-concentration, it did not show observable magnetization and MÃ¶ssbauer spectrum. It is found that the collinear ferromagnetic phase persists upto the ferromagnetic percolation limit by exhibiting a linear correlation with TÆ as a function of X.",0

Magnetic properties of polycrystalline Fe x TiS2 (0 < x â©½ 0.42) are studied. Magnetization and ac-susceptibility measurements show that compounds with x < 0.38 are spin glasses and those with 0.38 â¤ x â¤ 0.42 are ferromagnets.

"In the current investigation, damage resistance of stitched/unstitched S2-glass/epoxy composites is studied. Five layer stitched/unstitched plain weave S2-glass woven fabric composite laminates were manufactured using toughened SC15 epoxy resin system. For stitching, two configurations: one with 25.4 mm grid and other with 12.7 mm grid, were used with 6 mm pitch. Damage resistance was evaluated by subjecting 100Ã100 mm samples to low velocity impact loading at energy levels ranging 10â80 J using DYNATUP Model 8210, an instrumented impact test system. Three samples were tested at each energy level. The extent of damage was evaluated using ultrasonic C-scan. Results of the study indicate that stitching confined the damage size. As the damage was low over most of the energy range, the study was further extended to determine the effect of repeated impact loading. Under this study, laminates were subjected to repeated impact loading up to maximum of 40 impacts at energy levels ranging from 10 to 50 J. Results of repeated impact study are reported in terms of peak load, absorbed energy and projected damage area. All the laminates, sustained repeated impact loading up to 30 J. Beyond 30 J, laminates failed to carry repeated loading beyond certain numbers, which depended on the laminate configuration.",0
"Four quanternary Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) were selected, including the Zr46Ti2Cu45Al7, Zr61Ti2Cu25Al12, Zr55Ti4Ni22Al19 and Zr55Ti2Co28Al15, due to their robust glass-forming ability and containing a single species of late transition metal (LTM) in compositions. Their pitting resistances in 0.6M NaCl aqueous solution were investigated to examine the role of LTM elements in the alloys, with electrochemical measurements, surface morphology observation and x-ray photoelectron spectrometry analysis. It is shown that in comparision with two Cu-bearing BMGs, Zr55Ti4Ni22Al19 and Zr55Ti2Co28Al15 BMGs exhibited significantly superior resistance to pitting. Zr61Ti2Cu25Al12, Zr55Ti4Ni22Al19 and Zr55Ti2Co28Al15 BMGs manifested distinct passivation behaviour, because of the formation of surface passive film mainly comprising of ZrO2, TiO2 and Al2O3. However, no significant differences in the electrochemical resistive properties and thicknesses of passive films were found between Zr61Ti2Cu25Al12 and Zr55Ti4Ni22Al19 BMGs. Nevertheless, at the passive film/metal interface, copper enrichment took place in Zr61Ti2Cu25Al12, whereas the nickel was slightly deficient at the interface in Zr55Ti4Ni22Al19. During pitting propagation, selective dissolution of the zirconium, titanium and aluminum over the copper took place in Zr61Ti2Cu25Al12, but it was not the case in Zr55Ti4Ni22Al19. For the two Cu-bearing BMGs, reduction of passive base metal elements in composition resulted in local selective dissolution, even absence of the passivation.",0
"GeO2- PbO glass system doped with Sm3+ ion was synthesized and its structural and spectroscopic properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry, absorption and luminescence spectra.

Transition probabilities, radiative lifetimes, branching ratio and stimulated emission cross-section were estimated for the observed VIS-NIR emission. A novel NIR band corresponding to 4G5/2 to 6F11/2 transition was observed in the range from 1250 to 1350nm under excitation at 488nm.

"A theory is proposed to describe the competition among antiferromagnetism (AF), spin glass (SG) and Kondo effect. The model describes two Kondo sublattices with an intrasite Kondo interaction strength J K and a random Gaussian interlattice interaction in the presence of a transverse field Î . The Î field is introduced as a quantum mechanism to produce spin flipping and the random coupling has average - 2 J 0 / N and variance 32 J 2 / N . The path integral formalism with Grassmann fields is used to study this fermionic problem, in which the disorder is treated within the framework of the replica trick. The free energy and the order parameters are obtained using the static ansatz. In this many parameters problem, we choose J 0 / J â ( J K / J ) 2 and Î / J â ( J K / J ) 2 to allow a better comparison with the experimental findings. The obtained phase diagram has not only the same sequence as the experimental one for Ce 2 Au 1 - x Co x Si 3 , but mainly, it also shows a qualitative agreement concerning the behavior of the freezing temperature and the Neel temperature which decreases until a quantum critical point (QCP).",0
"Thermal stability is a critical consideration in the application of metallic glasses as hydrogen separation material. The development of new Ni-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with enhanced thermal stability is desirable. The present work investigated the alloying effects of refractory metals Hf and Ta on the Ni60Zr20Nb15Al5 bulk metallic glass. Two serial alloys, namely, Ni60Zr20â x Hf x Nb15Al5 (x =0â¼20at.%) and Ni60Zr20Ta y Nb15â y Al5 (y =0â¼15at.%), were investigated in the present work. The addition of Hf or Ta was revealed to be effective in improving the thermal stability of the basic alloy, while the glass-forming ability of the alloy is slightly reduced resulting from the addition of Hf or Ta. The possible mechanism of these alloying effects is discussed.",0
"Direct current and complex conductivities of pseudo-ternary chalcogenides from the Tl2Sî¸Sb2S3î¸As2S3 system are studied. The experimental data resulting from the electronic transport phenomenon are correctly interpreted by the C.B.H. (Correlated Barrier Hopping) model. We thus detail the elementary mechanism responsible for the current transport: in the particular case of chalcogenides, we can assume that hops are bielectronic. The experimental law for the polarization conductivity Ï' (Ï) = A (T) Ï s is confirmed theoretically by means of numerical calculations. This leads to the determination of the potential energy WM (about 2.5eV) and the number of sites (about 1025mâ3) in these pseudoternary compounds.",1

The absorption spectrum was recorded in the UVâvisible and NIR regions. The oscillator strengths of absorption bands were obtained by measuring the area under the bands. JuddâOfelt analysis has been carried out to estimate the host dependent JâO intensity Î©Î» (Î» =2, 4, 6) parameters by least squares fitting approach. Photoluminescence spectra recorded in the visible region revealed intense green, orange and red emission bands in all the glasses, corresponding to the 4 G 5 / 2 â 6 H 5 / 2 , 4 G 5 / 2 â 6 H 7 / 2 and 4 G 5 / 2 â 6 H 9 / 2 transitions respectively. From the emission spectra and JâO intensity parameters, various radiative parameters were calculated from the excited 4 G 5 / 2 to the lower lying 6 H J (J =5/2, 7/2, 9/2, 11/2) multiplet. Quenching of luminescence with the increase of Sm3+ ions concentration has been observed. Decay times of excited 4 G 5 / 2 state decrease with the increase of the Sm3+ ions concentration. The energy transfer mechanism that leads to the quenching of 4 G 5 / 2 state lifetime has been discussed. InokutiâHirayama (IâH) model was used to evaluate various energy transfer parameters, which are the qualitative indicators for the interaction among Sm3+ ions.",1

The absorption coefficient of high-purity ZBLAN glass varies with power and fluence upon irradiation at 5 eV with an excimer laser. The change has been attributed to two-photon absorption. The magnitude of the two-photon absorption coefficient is determined to be 3.05 Ã 10â9cm/W.,1

"Polymer composite materials reinforced by continuous fibers have excellent in-plane strength but are usually weak against delamination. This paper presents an experimental study of using carbon nanofibers (CNF) to improve the interlaminar fracture properties of polyester/glass fiber composites. Surfactant-treated CNF were dispersed in polyester resin and then the CNF-resin suspension was infused to impregnate a glass fiber preform using vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM). The manufacturability of using VARTM for thick and large CNF toughened composite parts has been experimentally investigated. The influence of CNF concentration on the CNF filtration in the glass fiber preform, the resin viscosity, and the micro-void formation has been examined. By choosing appropriate manufacturing parameters, we were able to use VARTM process to infuse the surfactant-treated CNF/resin matrix into the glass fiber preform and successfully manufactured the CNF toughened polyester/glass fiber composite specimens for mode-I delamination tests. The critical energy release rates of mode-I delamination (G IC) were characterized for several composite specimens with 1wt% CNF concentrations and for those with pure resin. Significant improvement in the G IC was consistently observed as 1wt% CNF were added to toughen the polyester resin. Microscopy pictures showed that the fracture surfaces of the 1wt% CNF toughened polyester/glass fiber composite samples were more complex than the fracture surfaces of regular polyester/glass fiber composites.",0
The magnetic properties of small 4d transition metal clusters are studied in the framework of a self-consistent tight-binding Hamiltonian.

"We investigated the thermal stability and spectroscopic properties of the 1.53 Î¼m emission from 4I13/2 â 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions in Er3+/Yb3+-codoped Ga-Bi-Pb-Ge heavy metal oxide glass for use in broadband fiber amplifiers. It was noted that the addition of GeO2 effectively enhanced the thermal stability of the heavy metal oxide glass studied. The emission peak located at approximately 1530 nm with a full width at half-maximum of approximately 58 nm. The measured lifetime and the calculated emission cross-section of this transition were â¼3.2 ms and â¼10.3Ã10â21 cm2, respectively.

"Objective To investigate the load-bearing capacity and failure mode of various types of glass ionomer cement (GIC) under Hertzian indentation, exploring the relationship between the failure behavior and formulation, and examining claims of filler-reinforcement of GIC. Methods Discs 2mm thick, 10mm diameter, 8â18 replicates, were fabricated for two filler-reinforced GICs, four unmodified and unreinforced GICs, and four resin-modified GICs, with a dental silver amalgam and a filled-resin restorative material for comparison. Testing was at 23Â°C, wet, after 7d storage at 37Â°C in artificial saliva at pH 6, using a 20mm diameter hard steel ball and filled-nylon substrate (E: 10GPa). First failure was detected acoustically; mode was determined visually. At least 1/3 of specimens in each case were examined under scanning electronic microscope for corroboration. Results Reinforced and unmodified-unreinforced GICs were indistinguishable by failure load (one-way analysis of variance, P =0.425, overall 260Â±70N) and mode. Failure loads for resin-modified GICs were 360â1150N, amalgam â¼680N, and filled resin â¼1200N. Resin-modified GICs tended to be tougher (incomplete fracture), all others gave complete fracture (radial cracking). The stronger materials (two resin-modified GICs and filled resin) showed some cone cracking. Significance While resin-modified GICs showed various extents of increase of failure load over that of the plain GICs, consistent with the hybrid chemistry, filler-reinforcement was not evident for the two claimed products, consistent with structural and theoretical expectations.",0

"Samarium doped sodium bismuth silicate glass was synthesized using the melt quenching method. Detailed optical spectroscopic studies of the glassy material were carried out in the UVâVis-NIR spectral range. Using the optical absorption spectra Judd-Ofelt (JO) parameters are derived. The calculated values of the JO parameters are utilized in evaluating the various radiative parameters such as electric dipole line strengths (Sed), radiative transition probabilities (Arad), radiative lifetimes (Ïrad), fluorescence branching ratios (Î²) and the integrated absorption cross- sections (Ïa) for stimulated emission from various excited states of Sm3+â¡ ion. The principal fluorescence transitions are identified by recording the fluorescence spectrum. Our analysis revealed that the novel glassy system has the optimum values for the key parameters viz. spectroscopic quality factor, optical gain, stimulated emission cross section and quantum efficiency, which are required for a high performance optical amplifier. Calculated chromaticity co-ordinates (0.61, 0.38) also confirm its application potential in display devices.",1
"This paper reports on the spectroscopic properties and energy transfer in Ga2O3âBi2O3âPbOâGeO2 glasses doped with Tm3+ and/or Ho3+. From the optical absorption spectra of Tm3+, JuddâOfelt intensity parameters, radiative transitions probabilities, fluorescence branching ratios, and radiative lifetimes have been calculated using JuddâOfelt theory. The measured differential scanning calorimetry result shows that the glass exhibits excellent stability against devitrification with ÎT =129Â°C. The measured luminescence spectra show that the 3H4 â 3F4 transition of Tm3+ upon 808nm laser diode excitation possess a broad full width at half-maximum of â¼126nm. The maximum value calculated stimulated emission cross-section and the measured lifetime of 3H4 level from the 1.47-Î¼m transition are â¼4.73Ã10â21 cm2 and â¼0.239ms, respectively.

"A novel Bi-doped P2O5âB2O3âAl2O3 glass was investigated, and strong broadband NIR (near infrared) luminescence was observed when the sample was excited by 445nm, 532nm, 808nm and 980nm lasers, respectively. The max FWHM with 312nm, the lifetime with 580Î¼s and the ÏemÏ product with 5.3Ã10â24 cm2 s were obtained which indicates that this glass is a promising material for broadband optical amplifier and tunable laser. The effect of the introduction of B2O3 on the glass structure and Bi-ions illuminant mechanism were discussed and analyzed. It is suggested that the introduction of B2O3 makes the glass structure closer, and the broadband NIR emission derives from Bi0:2D3/2 â 4S3/2 and Bi+:3P1 â 3P0 transitions.",1
"In this paper TOPEM DSC method was employed to investigate the glass transition region of fluorinated polyurethane cationomers. Fluorinated polyurethane cationomers have been synthesised in the reaction of MDI with poly(ethylene glycol) (600) and butane1,4-diol or N-methyl- or N-butyldiethanolamine and 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1,4-butanediol. Better rigidity was found for generally amorphous cationomer coats. It was found that introduction of fluorine compound changes thermal behaviour of polyurethane cationomers as well as leads to changes in the slope in activation diagram profiles of glass transition in comparison to polyuretahene cationomer without fluorine compound. Application of TOPEM DSC allows to obtain more information concerning frequency dependence of glass transition region and thermodynamical stability of polyurethane structures.",0
"In this paper, we present the absorption and photoluminescence properties of Pr3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+-doped transparent oxyfluoride alumino-silicate glass ceramics and Sm3+ and Dy3+-doped oxyfluoride germanate glasses. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) profiles of these glasses have been carried out, to confirm their structure and thermal stability. These glasses or glass ceramics have shown strong emission and absorption bands in visible and near-infrared (NIR) region. From the measured absorption spectra, JuddâOfelt (JâO) intensity parameters (Î© 2, Î© 4 and Î© 6) have been calculated for all the studied ions. Compared to Pr3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped glasses, their respective glass ceramics have shown stronger emissions due to LiGdF4 crystalline phase in alumino-silicate glass ceramics. For Pr3+ doped glass and glass ceramic, emission bands centered at 527nm(3P0â3H5), 610nm(3P0â3H6), 640nm(3P0â3F2), 678nm(3P1â3F3), 702nm(3P0â3F3) and 721nm(3P0â3F4) have been observed with 445nm(3H4â3P2) excitation wavelength. Of them, 640nm(3P0â3F2) has shown bright red emission. Emission bands of 4G5/2â6H5/2 (562nm), 4G5/2â6H7/2 (598nm), 4G5/2â6H9/2 (644nm) and 706nm(4G5/2â6H11/2) for the Sm3+: glass and glass ceramic, with excitation at 6H5/2â4F7/2 (402nm) have been recorded. Of them, 4G5/2â6H7/2 (598nm) has shown a bright orange emission. With regard to the Dy3+: glass and glass ceramic, a bright fluorescent yellow emission at 576nm(4F9/2â6H13/2) and blue emission at 485nm(4F9/2â6H15/2) have been observed, apart from 4F9/2â6H11/2 (662nm) emission transition for glass ceramic with an excitation at 388nm(6H15/2â4I13/2+4F7/2) wavelength. For germanate glasses, emission bands of 4G5/2â6H5/2 (564nm), 4G5/2â6H7/2 (601nm), 4G5/2â6H9/2 (644nm) and 705nm(4G5/2â6H11/2) for the Sm3+: glass, with an excitation at 6H5/2â4F7/2 (401nm) have been recorded. Of them, 4G5/2â6H7/2 (601nm) has shown a bright orange emission. With regard to the Dy3+: glass, a bright fluorescent yellow emission at 576nm(4F9/2â6H13/2) and blue emission at 482nm(4F9/2â6H15/2) have been observed, apart from 4F9/2â6H11/2 (661nm) emission transition with an excitation at 386nm(6H15/2â4I13/2+4F7/2) wavelength. The stimulated emission cross-sections of all the emission bands of Pr3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+: glasses and glass ceramics have been computed based on their measured full-width at half maxima (FWHM, ÎÎ») and measured lifetimes (Ïm ).",1
"We have discovered a methodology to realize the fabrication of flexible metal oxide film using two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets. Atomic scale titanium oxide (TiO x ) nanosheets were exfoliated from bulk TiO x powder that had a layered structure via the modified Sasakiâs method. The vacuum-assisted filtration generates films with laterally aligned TiO x nanosheets. The 2D sheet-like structure and hydrophilic nature of TiO x nanosheets enables the film consisting of TiO x nanosheets to be bendable. Also, we demonstrate the fabrication of electrochemical capacitors using this film. The mechanically flexible metal oxide film is expected to open up the possibility of fabricating flexible energy storage devices from 2D metal oxide nanosheets.",0
"The effect of the boundary conditions during uniaxial compression on the mechanical behavior of the Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 metallic glass has been evaluated by using a pure Cu foil as a lubricant material between loading platens and specimens. The results reveal that the soft metal is very effective for reducing the contact friction at the platenâspecimen interface, leading to a remarkable increase in plastic deformation with respect to more conventional semi-fluid lubricants.",0
"Tm3+ doped GaâAsâS chalcogenide glass samples were produced using As2S3 pure glass as starting materials. Their photoluminescence properties were characterized and strong emission bands were observed at 1.2Î¼m (1H5 â 3H6), 1.4Î¼m (3H4 â 3F4) and 1.8Î¼m (3F4 â 3H6) under excitation wavelengths of 698nm and 800nm. The thulium and gallium concentrations were optimized to achieve the highest photoluminescence efficiency. From the optimal composition, a Tm3+ doped GaâAsâS fiber was drawn and its optical properties were studied.",1
"An analysis of the toughness of fibrous materials is applied to glass reinforced plastic. The energy released immediately after a fibre or group of fibres breaks is found to constitute a significant proportion of the total energy dissipated in the formation of unit area of crack. Since the former quantity is given by a simple formula, this formula can be used to determine what properties of fibre, matrix, and interface will result in a tough composite.",0
"We have measured the notch toughness for a range of Cu-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Alloying additions that enhance the glass-forming ability (GFA) are found to degrade the toughness. Within this particular family of Cu-BMGs, toughness is more directly correlated with strength (and consequently with the shear modulus or glass transition temperature) than with the Poissonâs ratio. The Cu49Hf42Al9 BMG exhibits the best combination of GFA and toughness.",0
"Glass-forming regions of ternary GeTeAl glass are examined. The GeTeAl glass shows a relatively broad glass-forming region under liquid N2 quenching. Glass transition and crystallization temperatures of GeTeAl glasses are about 170 and 270Â°C, respectively, higher than those of binary GeTeAl glass. It is shown that the glass-forming region of GeTeSb glass is much smaller than that of GeTeAl glass, indicating that the GeTeAl glass has a relatively stable vitreous state and therefore has capabilities applicable to infrared optical fiber material.",1
"Ce3+, Eu3+ and Tb3+ singly doped and Ce3+/Eu3+ and Ce3+/Tb3+ co-doped zinc phosphate glasses were prepared by sintering P2O5, ZnO, Ce2(C2O4)3Â·10H2O and Eu2O3/Tb4O7 mixtures at 1200 Â°C in the air for 2 h and then annealing at 450 Â°C for 10 h. The obtained glasses were homogeneous and transparent. The glasses without Ce3+ were colorless and those with Ce3+ showed slightly yellow. The singly doped glasses showed strong emissions and excitations from doped trivalent rare earth ions. Strong energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3+ was observed for Ce3+/Tb3+ coped samples. There were also some very weak evidences for the energy transfer from Ce3+ to Eu3+.",1

"AZ31 magnesium alloy sheets were produced by conventional rolling at a temperature range of 433â523K and subsequent annealing. The process could be optimized to produce sheets with grains as fine as 2.8Î¼m in average size. Obvious dynamic recrystallization was found to occur during rolling at temperature above 473K. For the sheets rolled at temperature below 473K, a subsequent annealing was needed to obtain a fine fully recrystallized microstructure, which gives rise to a significant increase in ductility as compared with the as-rolled state. The sheets produced by the processing route in the present study exhibit excellent mechanical properties, with the yield strength and tensile elongation achieving as high as 350MPa and 35%, respectively. Their mechanical properties and the HallâPetch relationship were compared with those magnesium alloys processed by other deformation methods. The results show that the present process offers a cost-effective way to produce high-performance Mg alloy thin sheets.",0
"Sm2+ ions are attractive in high density memory applications due to its spectral hole burning property. In this study, for the first time, the influence of mixed valence states of Sm ions to magnetic and magneto optical property of diamagnetic glasses were studied. The chemical valence states of Sm and their modification on glass structure, optical absorption, luminescence, magnetic and Faraday rotation performances were characterized using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-Ray diffraction, Ultraviolet-visible (UVâVis), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), Raman spectra and vibrating-sample magnetization (VSM) measurements, respectively. Characteristic emission peaks due to 5D0â7F0 and 5D0â7F1 transitions of Sm2+ and 5G5/2â6H7/2, 5G5/2â6H9/2 transitions of Sm3+ ions were detected in luminescence spectra, indicating the reduction of Sm3+ to Sm2+. XPS analysis on Sm3d core-level spectra demonstrated the co-existence of Sm2+ and Sm3+ and their evolution was Sm2O3 content-dependent. Optical absorption of 6H5/2â4G5/2, 6F11/2, 6F9/2, 6F7/2, 6F5/2 transitions of Sm3+ ions were observed in UVâVIS spectra, however, the absorption peaks of Sm2+ were covered by the stronger absorption of Pb2+ and Bi3+ ions in the UV region. The refractive index, optical cutoff wavelength and band gap of glasses were changed by the incorporation of highly polarizable Sm ions. Due to the different magnetic ordering of Sm2+ and Sm3+ions, glass doped with 1%Sm2O3 presented diamagnetic nature while glasses doped with higher Sm2O3 exhibited paramagnetic behavior, and the Faraday rotation property also was greatly influenced by magnetization susceptibility. 1%Sm2O3 doped glasses presented the strongest magnetization and biggest Verdet constant of 0.1886Â min/G.cm at 633Â nm. Several influence factors to Verdet constant such as non-bridging oxygen structure, wavelength, refractive index, magnetic susceptibility and temperature were discussed.",0
"A study has been made of a concept of âhealingâ coatings applied onto the brittle fibre surface to reduce the stress concentrations and thus to improve the reinforcing efficiency in a composite. Coatings made from neat epoxy and carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced epoxy nanocomposite were applied onto the individual glass fibres as well as rovings. It is shown that the 0.3wt.% CNTâepoxy nanocomposite coating gave rise to a significant increase in tensile strength of the single fibre for all gauge lengths, better than the neat epoxy coating. The results on glass fibre roving also indicated a clear beneficial effect of nanocomposite impregnation on tensile strength. The rovings impregnated with the CNT nanocomposite exhibited a more uniform strength distribution and higher strengths than those impregnated with the neat epoxy. The changes in prevailing failure mechanisms influenced by the epoxy and nanocomposite coatings have been identified.",0
"Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes were prepared by Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on inexpensive Corning glass substrates using different under layers. The samples were functionalised by a simple 1H,1H-2H,2H perfluorodecyl-trichlorosilane (FDTS) and hexane mixture. The surface roughness of the CNTs and protective FDTS coating provides an ideal hydrophobic surface of around 141Â°. Auger spectroscopy analysis was performed to confirm fluorination of the sample. It was also found titanium provides a suitable under layer support for Ni catalyst due to the wetability of the two elements.",0
"Sm3+- and Eu3+-doped rare-earth borate glasses (Li2OâBaOâLa2O3âB2O3) have been fabricated and characterized optically. The density, refractive index, optical absorption, Judd-Ofelt parameters, and spontaneous transition probabilities have been measured, calculated and analyzed. Sm3+ and Eu3+ emit intense reddish-orange and red lights under blue and UV light excitations, respectively. In Sm3+ and Eu3+ co-doped glasses, the excitation wavelength range of Eu3+ emission is broadened owing to the energy transfer from Sm3+ to Eu3+. This broadening makes the Ar+ 488nm wavelength laser a powerful excitation source for Eu3+ fluorescence. The rare-earth doped glasses with various visible emissions are useful for developing new color light sources, fluorescent display devices, UV-sensor and tunable visible lasers.",1
"The fiber/matrix adhesion is most likely to control the overall mechanical behavior of fiber-reinforced composites. An interfacial reaction may result in various morphological modifications to polymer matrix microstructure in proximity to the fiber surface. The interactions between fiber and polymer matrix during thermal conditioning and thermal shock are important phenomena. Thermal stresses were built-up in glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composites by upthermal shock cycles (negative to positive temperature exposure) for different durations and also by downthermal shock cycles (positive to negative temperature exposure). The concentration of thermal stresses often results in weaker fiber/matrix interface. A degradative effect was observed in both modes for short shock cycles and thereafter, an improvement in shear strength was measured. The effects were shown in two different crosshead speeds during short-beam shear (SBS) test.",0
"The tensile strengths of polyester laminates have been examined with respect to E-glass fibreâunsaturated polyester resin (UPR) interfacial properties. The tensile strengths of the polyester laminates were determined as a measure of interfacial bond strength. In accordance with the principles of Factorial Design several compositions of UPRs were prepared varying three factors: the saturated to unsaturated acid ratio, the branched to linear ether glycol ratio and the amount of styrene. The influence of UPR composition on the tensile strength of polyester laminates is owing to the effects on flexibility of the cured UPR. The compositions with lower degrees of unsaturation and with higher amount of linear ether glycol increase the flexibility of UPRs, improve adhesion with E-glass fibre and consequently increase the tensile strength of the polyester laminates.",0
"Zr53.9Cu29.4Ni4.9Al9.8Fe2 alloy sample with the diameter of 3 mm was prepared by Cu mold suction casting at different temperatures. The effect of casting temperature on mechanical properties and microstructure of the as-cast alloy was investigated. It is found that there is a critical casting temperature for the fully amorphous structure, below which the crystallization phase might be precipitated. Experiment results show that the compressive strength increases and the compressive plasticity slightly decreases when the casting temperature increases to certain extent. However, the compressive strength and the compressive plasticity simultaneously increase when the casting voltage increases to 9 kV, and the compressive plasticity is 2.62%. Mechanical properties of BMG can be tailored to certain extent by controlling the casting temperature, which is correlated with free volume and residual stresses.",0
"The decreasing abrasive wear rate of tetragonal zirconia polycrystal ceramic (TZP) with increasing load under experimental conditions is believed to be caused by the martensitic transformation of t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2 in the abraded surface. The transformation toughened ceramics (TZP) appeared to give the best abrasive wear resistance among the ceramics studied in this experimental work. The surface failure of these ceramics was mainly due to the microfractural dropping and powder-type polishing scratches resulting from the brittle microfracturing part of the grain(s). Raising the fracture toughness wherever possible, in conjunction with a suitable hardness, will be beneficial in improving the abrasive wear resistance of ceramics.",0
"The crystallization kinetics of the newly Ge20Se60Sb20âxAgx (0Â â¤Â xÂ â¤Â 20 at %) chalcogenide glasses was characterized by DSC under non-isothermal conditions. Two well-defined crystallization exotherms were exhibited in the DSC traces for all Ag-containing glasses corresponding to the multiple-stage crystallization mode. The kinetic exponents n and m, that determine the crystallization reaction mechanism in the glasses, were obtained using the experimental values of the crystallized volume fraction, Ï. The initial crystallization stage is governed by bulk nucleation with one-dimensional growth. For the second exotherm the crystallization mechanism transforms from two-dimensional growth for xÂ =Â 0 into one-dimensional growth for xÂ =Â 20 at %. The activation energies for the glass transition, the first and second crystallization stages have been obtained. It was found that the crystallization products are the ternary phase Ag8GeSe6 for the first crystallization exotherm and the phases GeSe2 and Sb2Se3 for the second crystallization exotherm.",1
"The glass forming ability of copper-titanium alloys melt spun as ribbon in He and in air for the composition range 25â70 at.%Ti has been established from x-ray diffraction. The crystalline phases present in ribbons at the critical thickness were also identified. A singularly high GFA (tcrit Ë 135Î¼m) was observed for the equiatomic composition, although this transformed polymorphously to one phase contrary to previous suggestions that crystalline phase separation was essential for a high GFA.",0
"Influence of oxygen presence on the crystallization behavior of (GeS2)y(Sb2S3)1-y glasses (for y up to 0.3) was studied by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction analysis and infrared microscopy - the study was performed in dependence on particle size. The oxygen was found to significantly accelerate crystallization from mechanically induced defects for the (GeS2)0.1(Sb2S3)0.9 composition and to sustain the intensity of crystal formation in case of the (GeS2)0.2(Sb2S3)0.8 and (GeS2)0.3(Sb2S3)0.7 compositions. On the other hand, presence of oxygen influenced neither the morphology of the crystallites, nor the actual crystallization model-free and model-based kinetics. Direct microscopic observation confirmed strict surface crystallization for all studied composition. Compositional evolutions of the viscosity data and microscopically determined crystal growth rate curves have shown that it is the exceptionally high crystal growth rate and crystallization tendency (compared to the minor-to-moderate contribution of viscosity itself) that are responsible for the significant influenceability of the (GeS2)0.1(Sb2S3)0.9 crystallization by the presence of oxygen.",1
"Introduction LâhÃ©miagÃ©nÃ©sie thyroÃ¯dienne (HMT) est une anomalie congÃ©nitale trÃ¨s rare, due Ã une anomalie de dÃ©veloppement du lobe ou parfois du lobe et de lâisthme thyroÃ¯dien. Elle a Ã©tÃ© rapportÃ©e pour la premiÃ¨re fois par Handfield-Jones en 1866. Sa vraie incidence nâest pas bien connue. JusquâÃ prÃ©sent, 210Â cas ont Ã©tÃ© rapportÃ©s dans la littÃ©rature. Observation Patiente de 37ans, ayant comme antÃ©cÃ©dentsÂ : un diabÃ¨te type 2Â depuis 3ans sous antidiabÃ©tiques oraux, un syndrome sec suivi depuis 14ans. Lors du suivi de son diabÃ¨te, le bilan a rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© une hypothyroÃ¯die fruste, les AC anti-TPO sont nÃ©gatifs. Un complÃ©ment par Ã©chographie cervicale a montrÃ© un lobe droit qui mesureÂ : 60Ã26Ã14mm, de contours rÃ©guliers et de structure homogÃ¨ne, un isthme de 2mm et une absence du lobe gauche de la thyroÃ¯de.

"In traditional solar cells, metal-semiconductor contacts used to extract photogenerated carriers are very important. In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) not much attention has been given to contact between the TiO2 and the transparent conducting glass (TCO), which is used instead of a metal contact to extract electrons. TiO2 layers obtained by microwave-activated chemical-bath deposition (MW-CBD) are proposed to improve TiO2 contact to conducting glass. Spectra of incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) are obtained for two-photoelectrode TiO2 photoelectrochemical cells. IPCE spectra show higher values when TiO2 double layer photoelectrodes are used. In these, the first layer or contacting layer is made by MW-CBD. Best results are obtained for double layer photoelectrodes on FTO (SnO2:F) as conducting oxide substrate. Modeling of IPCE spectra reveals the importance of electrical contact and electron extraction rate at the TiO2/TCO interface.",0
The transition temperature T f of randomly distributed spins interacting via the RKKY interaction (spin glasses) has been calculated numerically within the spherical approximation. The dependence of T f on the concentration c of magnetic impurities and on the damping of the interaction due to a finite mean free path of the conduction electrons is investigated for 10â5 < c < 10â1.,0
"Multi-phase Fe90âx Zr10Cr x alloys with 0â¤ x â¤10 containing cubic C15 and hexagonal C14/C36 Laves phases have been prepared by copper mold casting. The microstructure of the samples consists of micrometer-sized Laves phase particles embedded in an ultrafine eutectic matrix of alternating lamellae of Î±-Fe and Laves phases. Room temperature compression tests of the binary alloy reveal a high strength of 1900MPa combined with a plastic strain of about 9%. The addition of Cr improves the plastic strain up to 17% while reducing the strength only by about 70MPa. The increased plastic deformation is linked to the specific structural features of the Laves phases. For the binary alloy, shearing and crack formation within the C15 phase limits plastic deformation. In contrast, in the samples containing Cr no shearing occurs within the C14/C36 phases and crack formation, which is observed at the particle/ferrite interface, is retarded.",0
Weight change behavior of fiber-reinforced polymer composites in humid and thermal environments appears to be a complex phenomena. The state of fiber/matrix interface is believed to influence the nature of diffusion modes. A significant weakening often appears at the interface during the hygrothermal ageing. It effects the moisture uptake kinetics and also the reduction of mechanical properties. The importance of temperature at the time of conditioning plays an important role in environmental degradation of such composite materials. An attempt has been made here to evaluate the deleterious effect of temperature on shear strength of carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy composites during hygrothermal conditionings. Mechanical tests were conducted at room temperature to assess the effectiveness of the relaxation process in the nullification of environmentally-induced damage in the composites.,0
"Silicate glass system with high contents of Fe2+ and Fe3+ was synthesized and the magnetic behaviors were examined. The glasses basically show superparamagnetism of magnetite clusters deposited in the materials. Furthermore, they show drastic descending shift of the field for ESR with decreasing temperature, as well as ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss law in DC susceptibility. Such behavior is interpreted with a model taking into account boundary interaction between the magnetite cluster and the surrounding amorphous region.",0
"Magnetic properties of Pd1âx Mn x alloys are investigated theoretically for a localized spin model for Mn atoms which are connected by long-range ferromagnetic interactions and short-range antiferromagnetic interactions. By using the multi-canonical Monte-Carlo simulation, the temperature variation of the specific heat and the probability distributions of the order parameter of the ferromagnetic state and the cluster glass state are calculated for each concentration. The obtained phase diagram is in good agreement with the experimental one.",0
"Effects of annealing temperature and time on microstructure and microhardness of Co41Ni2Fe20Ta5.5B26.5Si5 amorphous alloy have been investigated. Microhardness of the as-cast alloy is found to be 1170Â HV. The maximum microhardness,1798Â HV, is achieved after annealing the amorphous alloy at 1250Â K for 10Â min. Examination of the microstructure reveals that (Co,Fe)2B, (Co,Fe)21Ta2B6 and (Co,Fe)16Ta6Si7 phases precipitate in the matrix after annealing. Intrinsic hardness and HallâPetch coefficients of the precipitates indicate that high hardness values result from precipitation of (Co,Fe)2B and (Co,Fe)21Ta2B6 phases. It is also observed that increasing the annealing time results in the decrease in microhardness values because of the increase in particle sizes of the precipitates.",0
"Toxic element free-Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have attracted considerable attentions for biomedical applications, in term of their excellent bio-corrosion and mechanical properties. In the present work, we fabricated a series of Zr65-xTixCu20Al10Fe5 (xâ¯=â¯0, 2, 4, 6 and 8) alloys using the injection copper-mold casting method, and reported the significant effect of Ti addition both on mechanical performance and corrosion behavior. It is found the glass forming ability (GFA) and plasticity are significantly improved by increasing Ti content up to 2â¯at.%, but deteriorated after excess Ti additions. The obtained Zr63Ti2Cu20Al10Fe5 amorphous alloy provides the largest supercooled liquid region width of 73â¯K, compressive fracture strength of 1905â¯MPa and plasticity of 8.57%, which are much higher than 67â¯K, 1854â¯MPa and 5.43% of the pristine Zr65Cu20Fe5Al10 BMG. However, the electrochemical measurements show that as-prepared Zr63Ti2Cu20Al10Fe5 alloy exhibits a terrible passivation ability and inferior corrosion resistance in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, which is mainly ascribed to the numerous defects in the passive films. On the contrary, further addition of Ti to 4â6â¯at.% promotes the intactness of passive film for Zr-based BMGs and enhances their resistance to pitting corrosion, in despite giving rise to unsatisfied mechanical performance.",0
"In order to probe the magnetic ground state, we have carried out temperature-dependent magnetic Compton scattering experiments on an oriented single crystal of magnetite ( Fe 3 O 4 ) , together with the corresponding first-principles band theory computations to gain insight into the measurements. An accurate value of the magnetic moment Î¼ S associated with unpaired spins is obtained directly over the temperature range of 10â300K. Î¼ S is found to be non-integral and to display an anomalous behavior with the direction of the external magnetic field near the Verwey transition. These results reveal how the magnetic properties enter the Verwey energy scale via spinâorbit coupling and the geometrical frustration of the spinel structure, even though the Curie temperature of magnetite is in excess of 800K. The anisotropy of the magnetic Compton profiles increases through the Verwey temperature T v and indicates that magnetic electrons in the ground state of magnetite become delocalized on Fe B-sites above T v .",0
The metal-insulator phase transition is considered within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau approach for the phase transition described with two coupled order parameters. One of the order parameters is the mass density which variation is responsible for the origin of nonzero overlapping of the two different electron bands and the appearance of free electron carriers. This transition is assumed to be a first-order phase one. The free electron carriers are described with the vector-function representing the second-order parameter responsible for the continuous phase transition. This order parameter determines mostly the physical properties of the metal-insulator transition and leads to a singularity of the surface tension at the metalâinsulator interface. The magnetic field is involved into the consideration of the system. The magnetic field leads to new singularities of the surface tension at the metalâinsulator interface and results in a drastic variation of the phase transition kinetics. A strong singularity in the surface tension results from the Landau diamagnetism and determines anomalous features of the metalâinsulator transition kinetics.,0
"Natural fibre composites based woven jute and also heat treated woven jute, with epoxy resin as matrix were prepared and tested for its mechanical properties. Artificial FRP composites of carbon and glass were also prepared and tested. Heat treatment resulted in an increase in the tensile and flexural properties. Then heat treated jute FRP composites, artificial carbon and glass FRP composites were used for strengthening of beams, designed to undergo shear failure. Study conducted aimed at understanding the effect of various wrapping configurations, i.e. full and strip wrapping technique, for shear strengthening purpose and also aimed to understand the different load deflection behaviour displayed by the different types of FRPs and the failure modes that the strengthened beams underwent. The objective of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of natural bio-based woven jute FRP for shear strengthening purpose. Also included in the study whereas the effectiveness in terms of load carrying capacity, first cracking load, load-deflection behaviour, etc. obtained by retrofitting using bio-based woven jute FRP. The study concluded that the woven jute FRP retrofitting scheme had several advantages over carbon and glass FRP retrofitting scheme, and converted brittle failure mode of beams to ductile failure mode. Unlike carbon and glass FRP retrofitting the beams did not undergo any sudden debonding, or delamination or FRP rupture and depicted a complete ductile failure mode with high deflections. Non-linear finite element analysis was also conducted and the results were in good agreement with the experimentally obtained ones.",0
"Copper quantum dots embedded in sodium borosilicate glass matrix were fabricated and analyzed in terms of their structural, chemical, and optical properties. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that copper quantum dots were in face-centered-cubic crystalline phase and in the metallic state. Size and distribution of the quantum dots were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The results showed spherical shape have formed uniformly in the glass, and the size of these quantum dots were range from 1.5 to 5nm with the average particle size about 2.7nm. The third-order nonlinear optical properties of copper quantum dots doped glass were investigated by using Z-scan technique at the wavelength of 800nm with femtosecond Ti: sapphire laser radiation. The value of third-order optical nonlinear susceptibility Ï (3) of the glass was estimated to be 2.41Ã10â11 esu.",1
"The plastic deformation behavior of a traditional BMG with the composition of Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 was investigated in compression using the precursory-specimens with different casting sizes and hence different initial states. With increasing the mechanical-testing size of specimen, it is demonstrated that more pronounced action of elastic recoveries of testing machine and specimen led to a decrease in plasticity because of larger shear-strain was introduced in shear bands. Furthermore, for the specimens with the same mechanical-testing size, initial free-volume reduction with increasing the casting size of precursory-specimen also led to a degradation of plasticity as higher free-volume was required for higher shear band emission rate. Even the traditional BMG can be ductile as the casting size and mechanical-testing size of specimen were concurrently decreased to a certain extent. The understanding of the dual specimen-size dependences of plastic deformation capability of BMGs is helpful for the potential and reasonable engineering applications of BMGs.",0
"Powerful visible upconversion fluorescence intensities of Er3+ in novel bismuth gallate glasses (LKBBG) and common tellurite glasses (TZN) with low phonon energies and high refractive indices have been compared. Under the same measurement condition, Er3+-doped LKBBG glasses show the stronger upconversion emission intensities than Er3+-doped common tellurite glasses (TZN). The visible upconversion emission bands peaked at 531, 548 and 668nm have been confirmed that two photons contribute to these upconversion processes. The maximum phonon energy obtained in LKBBG glasses is 673cmâ1, which is 65cmâ1 lower than that in common tellurite glasses, indicating that LKBBG glasses almost possess the lowest maximum phonon energy in all of the oxide glasses. All analyses support that Er3+-doped LKBBG glasses are promising materials for fabricating visible upconversion devices.",1
"The limited plasticity of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is commonly circumvented by introducing micrometer- or nanometer-sized heterogeneities (crystallites and/or phase separation) into the BMGs. In this work, we report the improvement of plasticity in a ternary monolithic BMG caused by a large amount of randomly distributed free volume induced during solidification using a high cooling rate. This indicates that introducing large amounts of free volume into BMGs might be another promising way of improving the plasticity of these materials.",0
"Nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (N-CNFs) were facilely prepared by carbonizing electrospun polyacrylonitrile@polyaniline coreâshell nanofibers. The obtained N-CNFs possessed the favorable properties of high nitrogen content, large surface area, hierarchical porosity and good conductivity, which as ideal supports have been decorated by CuO nanoparticles through a facile solvothermal approach. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the properties of N-CNFs and CuO nanoparticles, the obtained CuO/NâCNFs modified on glassed carbon electrodes (CuO/NâCNFs/GCE) have demonstrated desirable activity for direct electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose with much higher sensitivity than that of pure CuO nanoparticles and CuO/CNFs composites. This could be ascribed to the fast electron transport/collect within the 3D conductive networks, which was very beneficial to improve the sensitivity to glucose detection for CuO/CNFs modified electrodes. In addition, the CuO/N-CNFs/GCE also presented a low detection limit to glucose, good selectivity to the general interferences in blood as well as high stability with long-term exposed in air. Therefore, the prepared CuO/N-CNFs modified electrodes by the facile synthesis method presents the potential possibility for practical application in non-enzymatic glucose sensor.",0
"Compression tests have been conducted at 900Â Â°C at a strain rate of 10â4 sâ1 for Nbâ15 at.% Alâ10 at.% Ti, â25 at.% Ti and â40 at.% Ti alloys in the initial conditions and after aging. The 10Ti and 25Ti alloys were in the as-cast condition, and the 40Ti alloy was in the hot-rolled condition. Specimens were aged for 10 or 100 h at 873 K (600Â Â°C), 1173 K (900Â Â°C) and 1373 K (1100Â Â°C). The microstructures were characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy. There was a marked increase in strength for all conditions as the Nb content increased. This is attributed not only to solid solution strengthening of the Î² phase, but also increased volume fraction of the harder Nb3Al Î´ phase. The 40Ti alloy remained a single phase (B2 structure) for all heat treatments, but Î´ and an unidentified phase (probably O) was present after testing following aging at 1173 K (900Â Â°C). There was no significant effect of aging on the strength. The 25Ti and 10Ti alloys showed increased strength with increasing aging temperature and time, which correlated to the increased amount of the Î´ phase.",0
"A highly stable substrate used for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was fabricated by combining two-step electric field-assisted diffusion (EFAD) with subsequent annealing. The samples were characterized by UV/Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SERS activity of these substrates was evaluated by using Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as the probe molecule. The results showed that the Raman signals were significantly enhanced in our substrates. The reverse EFAD process was applied to induce larger silver NPs or aggregates formed in the glass, leading to a stronger SERS signal. The enhancement factor about 106 and the detection limit of 10â9 M for R6G were achieved. This method is also very simple and cost-effective and provides a novel pathway for the development of future SERS sensor chips.",0
"Neutron powder diffraction measurements were performed on Fe70Al30 alloy in order to determine the relationship between the magnetic behaviour and the structural changes observed in this alloy. Results show that the re-entrant spin-glass behaviour is linked with D03 structure. There is a strong correlation between the lattice parameter and the diffraction peak intensity and all the magnetic changes reported in literature can be explained in terms of this relationship. Finally, magnetovolume effects similar to invar effect are reported in the spin-glass phase.",0
"Dy3+-doped Ga-Sb-S and Ga-Sb-S-PbI2 chalcohalide glasses were prepared by traditional melt quenching method. The effect of halide PbI2 on the physical and optical properties of Dy3+ ions was investigated. The density and ionic concentration of the host sample increased with the introduction of PbI2 halides, whereas the refractive index at 1.55â¯Âµm decreased. The Judd-Ofelt parameters showed that Î©2 increased in PbI2-modified glass, whereas the Î©6 value showed the opposite tendency. Infrared emission spectrum also showed that the intensity increased with PbI2 addition, and considerable enhancement at 2.8â¯Âµm was observed in the mid-infrared region. The halide PbI2 promoted the reduction of phonon energy of the host and the improvement of the laser pump efficiency, which led to the construction of optimized infrared glass materials for optical applications.",1
"Previous studies have suggested fiber reinforced self-compacting concrete (SCC) are more stable for efficient buildings. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Metkaolin (MK) and Alkali resistant glass fibers on the performance of SCC. In this study rheological (L-Box, slump flow, T50), mechanical (compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strength), and durability (chloride ion penetration and water absorption) properties were investigated. It was observed from the test results there was a reduction in workability with an increase in fiber content. It was found that glass fibers did not impart positive effect on the compressive strength of concrete. The split tensile and flexural strength of glass fibered SCC increased with increase in fiber dosage. The durability studies show that inclusion of GF marginally reduces the resistance to chloride ion and water absorption of concrete. The results show that the presence of both MK and GF in optimal percentages, can improve the mechanical properties and durability of self-compacting concrete significantly.",0
"Optical absorption and near-infrared luminescent properties of Nd3+ ions doped oxyfluorosilicate (NKZLSNd) glasses were investigated. Raman spectrum was recorded to investigate the structural properties of NKZLSNd glasses. The JuddâOfelt theory (JO) has been applied to the absorption spectrum of 1.0mol% Nd3+-doped oxyfluorosilicate glass to derive the JO intensity parameters (Î©Î» ), which are in turn used to calculate the radiative properties of Nd3+ ions luminescent levels. The near-infrared emission spectra recorded with 808nm laser diode excitation revealed the effective bandwidths values around 30â40nm for the 4F3/2 level of Nd3+-doped oxyfluorosilicate glasses. The measured decay times of 4F3/2 level decreased with increasing Nd3+ ions concentration due to the concentration quenching.",1
"Optical properties of zirconium oxide films on glass substrates deposited by thermal oxidation method have been studied at different temperatures. Optical characteristics of films such as refractive index, extinction coefficient, average thickness and optical dielectric constants were calculated using Swanepoel's method. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and atomic force microscopy were performed to investigate the film structure and morphology. It was found out that the optical properties of zirconium oxide films are affected by oxidation temperature which are due to changes of film microstructure and surface roughness.",0
"Waste glass sludge (WGS), a byproduct of glass plate manufacture, was used to improve the durability properties of concrete under an environmental condition of freezing and thawing, with the existence of de-icing salts. A total of five concrete mix proportions were prepared, by varying the amounts of WGS. In order to observe the effects and roles of WGS on the durability performances of concrete mixtures, compressive strength tests, freezing and thawing tests, chloride ion penetration and surface scaling were carried out. Test results showed that the incorporation of WGS as a partial replacement for cement has beneficial effects on the compressive strength of concrete, especially when used together with fly ash. Moreover, WGS improved the resistance of freezing and thawing with and without de-icing salts, the chloride ion penetration and the resistance of surface scaling of the concrete compared to the control mixture containing 20% fly ash as cement replacement.",0
"A new model is described to calculate the dc conductivity activation energy of ionically conducting glasses. The activation energy is associated with surmounting the potential barrier corresponding to the saddle-point configuration, when the mobile ion is at the mid-point of a face of the coordination polyhedron comprised of anions surrounding a stable cation site. Coulombic, polarization, repulsion and realistic strain-energy terms in the interaction potential are considered. It is found that, at very low ion concentrations, the Coulombic term dominates and the activation energy is high, while at high ion contents, the polarization term is dominant and the activation energy is much lower. Thus, the observed decrease in activation energy with increasing ion content is explained. Implications for the ac conductivity are briefly discussed.",1
"The microstructural and property evolution of a novel AlâZnâMgâScâZr sheet during its preparation were investigated in detail by tensile tests and electron microscopy methods. The results show that severe segregation exists in the ingot. After homogenization treatment at 470Â°C for 12h, dissoluble Zn and Mg enriched non-equilibrium phases dissolve into matrix completely and only little indissoluble impurity phases containing Fe and Si elements remain. At the same time, precipitation of nanometer-scaled coherent secondary Al3(Sc, Zr) particles from a supersaturated solid solution occurs. The proper homogenization process is 470Â°CÃ12h. After solution treatment at 470Â°C for 1h, a lot of non-equilibrium T(Mg32(Al,Zn)49) phases formed during hot rolling dissolve into matrix. Aged at 120Â°C, the precipitates gradually transform from coherent GP zones to semi-coherent Î·â² phase and incoherent Î· phase for the duration of aging, exhibiting a typical behavior of aging strengthening. The optimal solution-aging process is solution treated at 470Â°C for 1h, followed by water quenching and then aged at 120Â°C for 24h (peak-aged). Under this condition, the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation reach 555Â±2MPa, 524Â±4MPa and 12.3Â±0.6% respectively. The main strengthening mechanisms of AlâZnâMgâScâZr aged sheets are precipitation strengthening derived from Î·â² precipitates, and dispersion strengthening and sub-grain strengthening caused by coherent secondary Al3(Sc, Zr) particles.",0
"The parameters of shear band evolution with deformation were examined in the Vit105 bulk metallic glass. For this purpose, two halves of disks of the bulk metallic glass were joined together and processed by high-pressure torsion for various strains: from compression without rotation, to rotation for 5 revolutions. The discrepancy between the experimentally observed and predicted shear strains was detected. The actual strain is significantly smaller than the predicted one. The SEM examination of the internal surfaces of two joint halves of an HPT-processed disk allowed to study the formation and accumulation of shear bands under an increased imposed strain. The maximum density of the shear bands is observed at the edges of the HPT samples and in areas adjacent to the upper anvils. An increase in strain leads to an increase in the shear bands density. The observed minimum shear band spacing is equal to 0.5â¯Î¼m after HPT processing for 5 revolutions. According to the structural changes recorded by XRD (an increase in the free volume content by about 1.3%) and formation of a high density of shear bands, HPT leads to a significant structural transformation of the amorphous structure of the BMG.",0
"A new family of transparent phosphate glasses having compositions 60% P2O5, 13% ZnO, 5%Al2O3, 22%(La2O3+Nd2O3) (wt%), slightly violet coloured have been synthesised, using a regular melting technique to obtain new optical luminescent hosts and eventually giving laser effect particularly at 1300 nm. IR fluorescence spectra investigation under different laser excitations at room temperature and 77 K show three major emissions situated at 1050, 1067, 1082 nm. The variation of 4F3/2 â 4I11/2 band width from 25.4 to 28.4 nm with the excitation change, demonstrates the crystal field inhomogeneity around the cation sites, whereas the (4F3/2 â 4I13/2) is not affected and Ipeak(4F3/2 â 4I11/2)/Ipeak (4F3/2 â 4I13/2) was â¼7. The intensities of visible luminescence spectra are concentration dependent under the 514.5 nm continuous laser excitation. A radiative decay time is calculated on the basis of the JuddâOfelt theory.",1
"Microstructural characteristics are crucial in understanding and predicting the behavior of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars used for concrete reinforcement. Considering the lack of extensive GFRP microstructural knowledge, the main purpose of this study is to provide a documentation of GFRP microstructure and demonstrate its contribution in the durability of GFRP bars. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was performed at different magnification levels on the cross-section of four different commercially available pristine GFRP bars. As a result of differences in the production method by pultrusion, each pristine bar presented a unique microstructural pattern including voids, defects, and fiber distribution. Two of the bars which demonstrated the most different patterns were exposed to accelerated conditioning in alkaline solution. The horizontal shear test was performed and the results were compared with the pristine bars. The difference in microstructural patterns was found to significantly contribute to GFRP durability. These results can be used as a benchmark for the microstructure of commercially available pristine GFRP bars and serve as a base for monitoring possible changes after any conditioning or testing.",0
"We discuss the fabrication of highly conductive Ta-doped SnO2 (Sn1â x Ta x O2; TTO) thin films on glass by pulse laser deposition. On the basis of the comparison of X-ray diffraction patterns and resistivity (Ï) values between epitaxial films and polycrystalline films deposited on bare glass, we proposed the use of seed-layers for improving the conductivity of the TTO polycrystalline films. We investigated the use of rutile TiO2 and NbO2 as seed-layers; these are isostructural materials of SnO2, which are expected to promote epitaxial-like growth of the TTO films. The films prepared on the 10-nm-thick seed-layers exhibited preferential growth of the TTO (110) plane. The TTO film with x =0.05 on rutile TiO2 exhibited Ï =3.5Ã10â4 Î©cm, which is similar to those of the epitaxial films grown on Al2O3 (0001).",1
The systematics of structural trends in the SixSe1âx 0.0â©½xâ²0.40 glass system have been summarized for r â©½ 9 A Ì . Changes in structure for 0.0â©½xâ²0.23 are characterized by a linear dependence upon x. This linear dependence leads to the novel observation of Diffraction Isosbestic Points. Abrupt changes in the nature of the structure of these glasses occur at x â¼ 0.23 and x = 0.33. The structures of glasses in the composition range 0.0â©½xâ².23 may be understood in terms of a clustered unit model. Changes in both nearest neighbor and molecular ordering underlie the dramatic structural rearrangements which occur about the x = 0.33 composition.,1
"Objective This in vitro study was designed to investigate the influence of the veneer and cyclic loading on the failure behavior of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LDG) crowns on maxillary first molar. Methods Sixty-four LDG crowns were divided into 4 groups (n =16). Thirty-two monolithic crowns were fabricated from IPS e.max Press (M), and the remaining bilayered crowns using cut-back technique and conventional manual layering technique from IPS e.max Press/Ceram (B). Monolithic or bilayered crowns were subjected to single-load-to-fracture (SLF) testing using a universal testing machine, before (M1 and B1) and after exposure to sliding-contact fatigue (SCF) testing (M2 and B2), consisting of 1,200,000 mechanical cycles (F max =98N). Data were statistically analyzed using two-by-two factorial design ANOVA. Fractographic analysis was performed to determine the fracture modes of the failed specimens. Results The mean fracture load values (N Â±S.D.) for M1, B1, M2 and B2 were 2686Â±628N, 1443Â±327N, 2133Â±578N and 1464Â±419N, respectively. Significant differences were found between the failure loads of all groups (P <0.001), except between groups B1 and B2. Bulk fracture initiating from the occlusal surface is the primary failure mode of monolithic and veneered LDG crowns. Cracking that initiated from coreâveneer interfacial defects and ultimately resulted in bulk fracture is another major failure origin of veneered all-ceramic crowns. Significance Veneer application resulted in significantly lower fracture load values compared to monolithic LDG crowns. Cyclic loading is an accelerating factor contributing to fracture for monolithic LDG crowns but not for bilayered ones.",0
The magnetic anisotropy of a Fe80B20 (METGLAS 2605) metallic glass has been investigated by MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy. The direction of magnetization is shown to be strongly temperature dependent with an unusually large out-of-plane component. The similarities between the electronic structure of this glassy alloy and the Fe2B and FeB intermetallic compounds are discussed briefly.,0
"This work compares the self-cleaning properties of experimental TiO2 and TiO2âAg coatings on float glass with a commercial self-cleaning glass. In the experimental surfaces, TiO2 coating was applied to float glass via the solâgel route, while TiO2âAg coating was applied by the liquid flame spray method, which deposits TiO2âAg composite nanoparticles on the surface. The effect of the coatings on the surface wettability and the activation time for achieving hydrophilicity was studied through water contact angle as a function of exposure time to UV light. The surface morphology was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal optical microscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the coatings was examined with methylene blue and stearic acid degradation tests. Finally, the soil attachment to the surfaces was tested with a sebum-based model soil. The solâgel TiO2 coating became superhydrophilic within a few hours, while the activation time needed for the commercial titania coated glass was several days. The surface with the TiO2âAg nanoparticles did not show any marked changes in the water contact angle. The commercial titania coated and the solâgel TiO2 surfaces showed self-cleaning properties and clearly lower attachment of soil than the uncoated and TiO2âAg coated surfaces. The difference in the interaction of the surfaces with the organic contaminants was assumed to depend mainly on differences in the thickness of the coatings.",1
"We fabricated superhydrophobic and transparent silica nanoparticle (SNP) films on glass plates via spray-coating technique. When suspensions containing 1-propanol and hydrophobic SNPs were sprayed over glass plates that were modified with dodecyl groups, superhydrophobic and transparent SNP films were formed on the substrates. Surface energy of the glass plates had a significant role to obtain superhydrophobic and transparent SNP films. SNP films did not show superhydrophobicity when bare glass plates were used as substrates, because water droplets tend to adhere the exposed part of the hydrophilic glass plate. Glass plates having extreme low surface energy were not also suitable because suspension solution was repelled from the substrates, which resulted in forming non-uniform SNP films.",0
"This paper investigates the mechanical properties of woven glass/epoxy composites modified with multi-walled nanotube (MWNT) and n-butyl glycidyl ether (BGE) under tensile static and cyclic loadings at cryogenic temperatures. Tensile tests were conducted at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K), and the tensile properties of the composites were evaluated. Tensionâtension fatigue tests were also performed on the composites at 77K in order to assess their fatigue performance. Failed specimens were examined by microscopy to verify the failure mechanisms.",0
Polyvinyl alcoholâcarbon nanotube (PVAâCNT) fibers were embedded in glass fiber reinforced plastic composites and used as strain sensors for damage monitoring of the composite. Sensing of the structural integrity of the composite was made by the in situ measurement of the electrical resistance of the embedded PVAâCNT fiber during the mechanical tests. The multi-functional materials were tested in tensile progressive damage accumulation (PDA) tests. These tests aimed to seek the electrical response of untreated and pre-stretched PVAâCNT fibers with known level of progressively induced damage to the composite. The advantages and disadvantages of each PVAâCNT fiber used as a sensor are analyzed; the electrical resistance readings of the PVAâCNT fibers were correlated with known parameters that express the induced damage of the composite.,0
"Glasses of the (50âx/2)Na2OâxZnOâ(50âx/2)P2O5(3â¤O/Pâ¤3.49) and (50âx)Na2OâxZnOâ50P2O5 (O/P=3) (0â¤xâ¤33mol%) compositions were prepared using the conventional melt quenching technique. The increase of density and glass transition temperature in both series is related to the reticulation of phosphate chains. For the first series of glasses, Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR), Raman and 31P solid state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy revealed the decrease of Q2 tetrahedral sites and the increase of phosphate dimers (Q1), indicating the shortening of phosphate chains. For the second series, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy show only the presence of Q2 tetrahedral sites. Dissolution of these series in 4.5% weight of H3PO4 solution has been followed calorimetrically and showed that the dissolution of the first series is endothermic for the low ZnO content and becomes exothermic when x rises. This behavior is correlated to the structural modification. For the second series, the dissolution phenomenon is endothermic confirming the presence of the same structure over the whole composition range.",1
"The microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of an AZ61 alloy that was processed with a combination of two-step equal-channel angular pressing (TS-ECAP) and electropulsing treatment (EPT) processing were investigated herein. After the second-step ECAP (SS-ECAP) for 4 passes, the dislocation densities and stored deformation energy of the AZ61 alloy continuously accumulated to reach maximum values of 3.03Â ÃÂ 1014Â mâ2 and 41.2Â J/g, respectively. The results were attributed to a decrease in the extrusion temperature, accumulated deformation and grain refinement. Compared with the properties of the as-received AZ61 alloy, the best comprehensive mechanical properties were obtained by the TS-ECAP and EPT method. First, the grain size of the samples after the EPT was refined from 30Â Î¼m to 1Â Î¼m. Second, the yield strength and tensile strength significantly increased from the initial values of 250Â MPa and 350Â MPaâ305Â MPa and 426Â MPa, respectively. Additionally, the elongation was greatly improved from 6.8% to 18.3%, which is an increase of three times over that of the as-received AZ61 alloy. In conclusion, a uniform and ultrafine-grained structure was obtained in the samples after an EPT, where static recrystallization was completed at a relatively low temperatures and in a short time.",0
"The structure and the devitrification behavior of barium aluminoborate glasses, examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction are reported. The glass compositions are expressed by the general formula: (50â x/2)BaOÂ·(50â x/2)B2O3Â·xAl2O3 with x=2, 4 and 8. All the as-quenched glasses were phase separated. Aluminum acting as glass former gives a more polymerized structure increasing the glass stability with respect to the devitrification process. Surface crystallization was found to be dominant for all glasses, forming Î²BaB2O4 nanocrystals as the main crystalline phase.",1
"A study on the flexural properties of hybrid composites reinforced by S-2 glass and T700S carbon fibres is presented in this paper. Specimens were manufactured following the hand lay-up process in an intra-ply configuration with varying degrees of glass fibres added to the surface of a carbon laminate. These specimens were then tested in the three point bend configuration in accordance with ASTM D790-07 at a span to depth ratio of 32. The failure modes were examined under an optical microscope, and the results show that the dominant failure mode is compressive failure. The flexural modulus, flexural strength and strain to failure were also predicted by finite element analysis. It is seen that flexural modulus decreases with increasing percentage of S-2 glass fibres. Both the experiments and FEA suggest that positive hybrid effects exist by substituting carbon fibres with glass fibres.",0
The paper is based on a study to develop carbonâglass epoxy hybrid composites with desirable thermal properties for applications at cryogenic temperatures. It analyzes the coefficient of thermal expansion of carbonâepoxy and glassâepoxy composite materials and compares it with the properties of carbonâglass epoxy hybrid composites in the temperature range 300K to 125K. Urethane modified epoxy matrix system is used to make the composite specimens suitable for use even for temperatures as low as 20K. It is noted that the lay-up with 80% of carbon fibers in the total volume fraction of fibers oriented at 30Â° and 20% of glass fibers oriented at 0Â° yields near to zero coefficient of thermal expansion as the temperature is lowered from ambient to 125K.,0
"The structural, electronic, elastic and thermal properties of two lutatium mono-pnictides (LuAs and LuSb) have been studied using the density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation. The calculations indicate that there is a structural phase transition from their ambient NaCl â (B1) to CsCl â (B2) structure at 56.7 and 25.2GPa along with the volume collapse percentage of 3% and 5%, respectively. Structural parameters like lattice constant (a 0), bulk modulus (B) and pressure derivative of the bulk modulus (Bâ²) are presented. The calculated band structures indicate that B1 and B2 phase of these compounds are metallic. We have calculated the second order elastic constants for these compounds. We also compare the ground state (a 0 and B) and high pressure phase transition (P t) properties for three members of lanthanide series.",0
"Amorphous Ge x Se100âx (with x=10, 20 and 40at%) alloys were prepared using the meltâquench technique. Two-dimensional Monte Carlo of the total pair distribution functions (MCGR) have been found and used to assemble the three-dimensional atomic configurations using the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method. The simulations are useful to compute the partial pair distribution functions g Ge â Ge r m c ( r ) , g Ge â Se r m c ( r ) , g Se â Se r m c ( r ) and the partial structure factors S Ge â Ge r m c ( r ) , S Ge â Se r m c ( r ) , S Se â Se r m c ( r ) of the studied glasses. The partial pair distribution functions indicate that the basic building units are GeSe4 and Ge2Se6 tetrahedral units in the Se-rich and Ge-rich glasses, respectively. Some of these tetrahedral units are connected by the homopolar units as confirmed by the bond angle distribution functions. The partial structure factors have shown that not only the homopolar GeâGe bonds, but also SeâSe bonds are behind the appearance of the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in the total structure factor.",1
"Three correlationships are established among the optical dielectric constant Îµâ, Szigeti effective charge e â s , transition temperature Tc , melting temperature Tm , and optical phonon frequency for many cubic fast ionic conductors. These relations suggest an intense influence of electronic energy state near the band gap to the origin of fast ionic conduction, dominant contribution of short-range or long-range forces to the mobile ion below Tc or to the cage ion above Tc . A curious temperature dependence for Îµâ and e â s values is also interpreted by considering anharmonic dynamical effective charge.",0
"Huge inter laminar stresses are induced in complex geometry of composite structural joints, for example, those utilized as a primary part of the aircraft structures. An inverted V shaped open mould covered with top plate was used to make L shaped complex geometries using unidirectional (UD) Glass with small amount of Cellulose as fillers at the curvature region in L shaped UD Glass and epoxy composites. But an understanding of the achieved mechanical property is required to improve the technology further and introduced it into industry. Initially tensile test was carried out to know the elastic modulus in the direction of 00 and 900 of UD Glass epoxy composite laminates followed by a four-point bend test was conducted on various L shaped specimen as per ASTM D6415 standard. The experimental results revels that the L shaped specimen made with 7.5wt% of Cellulose fillers in UD Glass gave higher inter-laminar stresses with respect to pristine UD Glass epoxy composite. Further, it is noticed that the UD Glass Cellulose epoxy composite showing increased fiber bridging at the curvature during loading. Finally, it is observed that an improved delamination in L bend composite specimen is achieved by incorporating Cellulose in UD Glass epoxy composite system",0
"Through an analysis on microstructure and high cycle fatigue (HCF) properties of Tiâ6Alâ4V alloys which were selected from literature, the effects of microstructure types and microstructure parameters on HCF properties were investigated systematically. The results show that the HCF properties are strongly determined by microstructure types for Tiâ6Alâ4V. Generally the HCF strengths of different microstructures decrease in the order of bimodal, lamellar and equiaxed microstructure. Additionally, microstructure parameters such as the primary Î± (Î±p) content and the Î±p grain size in bimodal microstructures, the Î± lamellar width in lamellar microstructure and the Î± grain size in equiaxed microstructures, can influence the HCF properties.",0
"Broadband infrared luminescence covering the optical telecommunication wavelength region of O,E and S bands was observed in GeO2: Bi,M (M=Ga,B) glasses prepared by conventional meltingâquenching technique. The luminescence with a maximum at around 1320nm possesses a full width at half maximum larger than 300nm and mean fluorescent lifetime longer than 500Î¼s when excited by an 808nm-laser. These glasses may have potential applications in widely tunable laser and super-broadband optical amplifier for the optical communications.",1
"Although most bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) will undergo ductile-to-brittle transition at cryogenic temperature, significant low temperature compression and tensile ductility have been found in a BMGC with the composition of Ti48Zr20Nb12Cu5Be15. In present work, the cryogenic mechanical behavior of BMGCs containing interstitial element was studied for understanding the multiple reinforcement of BMGCs in low temperature environment and for explaining the differences in cryogenic properties of BMGCs. Results show that the Ti-based BMGC will be much more sensitive to impurity elements in cryogenic environment than that at room temperature. Besides, the increase in yield strength of BMGCs with the decrease of temperature is not simply due to the dislocations motion in the dendrites becomes more difficult. Low temperature environment can strengthen the glassy matrix as well as increase the strength of dendrites. Results imply Ti48Zr20Nb12Cu5Be15 BMGC can be a kind of promising materials for low-temperature applications.",0
"Introduction From 1998 to 2002, we performed a trial of prospective limited resection for pulmonary ground-glass opacity lesions 2 cm or smaller. This is the second report on the long-term outcome. Methods The enrollment criteria of the trial were as follows: pulmonary peripheral nodule less than 2 cm, diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of clinical T1N0M0 carcinoma with ground-glass opacity and lack of evident pleural indentations or vascular convergence on high-resolution computed tomography. Limited-resection (wedge or segment) specimens were intraoperatively examined by frozen section. If the nodule was confirmed as Noguchi type A or B with a resection margin of greater than 1 cm, the incision was sutured and the patient followed up. The median surveillance period was 10 years. Results In a total of 50 enrolled participants, there were two Noguchi type A, 23 type B and 15 type C adenocarcinomas; five atypical adenomatous hyperplasias, four fibroses, and one granuloma. Although there were no patients with recurrence within the first 5 years, in four patients who underwent limited-resection pulmonary adenocarcinoma developed more than 5 years after the initial resection, of either cut-end recurrence or metachronous primary disease. Conclusions Of 26 patients who underwent limited resection, adenocarcinoma developed in four after more than 5 years. These were possibly cut-end recurrences. We concluded that 5 years is not a sufficient period for follow-up, and that limited resection should still be done only in a trial setting, even for small ground-glass opacity lesions.",0
"We demonstrate a new method to build inverted organic photodiodes with highly conducting polymer anodes. In the inverted design the cathode is deposited first, followed by the deposition of the active material and finally the anode. A cathode of bismuth was vacuum evaporated followed by the evaporation of a capping layer of C60. A semiconducting polymer, poly(3-(4â²-(1â³,4â³,7â³-trioxaoctyl)phenyl)thiophene) (PEOPT) was then spin-coated on the cathode, followed by a surface energy modification step and a subsequent spin-coating of the anode, a solution of glycerol and the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) with the polyelectrolyte poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS). As the pristine PEOPT was too hydrophobic to spin-coat the aqueous based PEDOT-PSS, the semiconducting polymer was silanized with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane to increase its surface energy before spin-coating of the PEDOT-PSS solution. The device geometry was proven successful by currentâvoltage measurements of devices in dark and under illumination.",0
"In this preliminary work, we demonstrated rod-type Zr44Ti11Cu9.8Ni10.2Be25 (LM1B) bulk metallic glass/crystalline copper composites fabricated by co-extrusion. The co-extrusion tests were carried out at three different temperature-punch speed combinations within supercooled liquid region of the LM1B bulk metallic glass. The influence of process conditions on the homogeneity of the area fraction between core and sleeve along the extrusion axis, the existence and thickness of the interface layer with or without defect, and overall strength of this bimetallic compound was systematically investigated by various experiments.",0
"Magnetic materials of strongly correlated origin are at the forefront of research in the exploration of new quantum mechanical properties involving spin and charges. Quantum magnetic material with certain intrinsic functionalities, such as continuously fluctuating spins to the lowest accessible temperature - reminiscing a liquid pattern, is argued to form a new phase of matter. Envisaging a phenomenon where the continuously fluctuating spins are also randomly frozen in space, can diminish the distinction between the two opposite extremes of quantum and classical magnetism. Here, we report new evidence in this regard where the coexistence of quantum spin continuum with a spin glass order in Co-doped CaRuO3 perovskite is demonstrated. In experimental investigations of Co-doped CaRuO3 perovskite, we find that (a) a continuum spectrum in the energy-momentum space, due to the uncorrelated spin fluctuations, persists across the weak spin glass transition at T G â 23Â K and (b) the quantum fluctuation of magnetic moment is spatially confined to individual sites only, thereby making it an extremely local event. Thus, the fluctuating spins, at a given time, are also randomly frozen macroscopically. The experimental observations suggest the discovery of a new magnetic phase at the cross-road of classical and quantum physics in strongly correlated perovskite materials.",0
"The Na2O-Y2O3-SiO2 glass with Tb3+ doped and Sm3+/Tb3+ co-doped was prepared by the melt-quenching, the glass ceramics containing Na9YSi6O18 crystal phase were prepared by two-step heat treatment. The structure, morphology, luminescence properties and fluorescence lifetimes were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmittance, photoluminescence spectra (PL), respectively. The research indicates that the nuclear temperature of glass ceramics is 550â¯Â°C and the time for 1â¯h, the optimum crystalline temperature is 620â¯Â°C, and the optimum crystalline time is 40â¯min. Moreover, the effect of Tb2O3 concentration on the luminescence properties of the glass ceramics were discussed. When the concentration of Tb2O3 was 0.5â¯mol%, the brightest green light was obtained at 547â¯nm (5D4â7F5). Meanwhile, the energy transfer process between Tb3+ and Sm3+was discussed in detail. Under the excitation of 376â¯nm, the white light can be obtained by adjusting the concentration ratio of Tb3+ and Sm3+. These results indicate that Sm3+/Tb3+ co-doped glass ceramics play an important role in the field of white light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs).",0
"The miscibility and interactions of binary blends of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) brominated (P4HSBR) with poly(Ïµ-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(vinyl acetate) (PVA) and poly(vinyl methylether) (PVME) are investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Glass transition temperatures, T gs, are used to assess the miscibility of these systems. All of them were found to be miscible over the whole composition range. T gs of the blends are lower than Fox predictions, in contrast to the results previously obtained for systems involving poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (P4HS). The melting of PCL in the blends was studied. From the melting temperature depression of PCL in the blends the polymerâpolymer interaction parameter was obtained and compared with the ones obtained for P4HS/PCL and poly(4-hydroxystyrene-co-methoxystyrene) (P4HSM)/PCL systems. The best interactions are achieved in P4HS/PCL and the bromination or methoxylation of the P4HS worsen the interactions with the PCL. The presence of a cusp in the T g-composition curve was analysed in terms of the Kovacs' theory in systems with P4HS and P4HSBR.",0
"Tellurite glasses of the composition xHo2O3-(7-x)RE2O3â3Na2O-25ZnO-65TeO2 were prepared by the melt quenching-technique. Absorption (300â¯K) and fluorescence (300â¯K) spectra as well as the lifetimes from excited states are presented and discussed in details. The analysis of the absorption spectrum at 300â¯K has been carried out for determination of phenomenological Î©Î» (Î»â¯=â¯2, 4, 6) Judd-Ofelt parameters. Based on the Judd-Ofelt theory, the radiative transition probabilities (A T ), branching ratios (Î² R ) and radiative lifetimes (Ï R ) of the emitting levels of Ho3+ ion have been determined. The experimental lifetime of the 5I7 level has been significantly reduced in comparison to the radiative lifetime. It was found that the quenching of emission from the 5I7 level of the Ho3+ ion is due to self-quenching process. The stimulated and effective emission cross-sections for the 5I7â5I8 transition have been calculated. The fluorescence from the 5S2 level is strongly dependent on the activator concentration. The obtained results show that among three types of glasses, Ho3+-doped Y2O3-Na2O-ZnO-TeO2 glasses are the most promising candidates for a 2â¯Âµm laser host as well as an efficient phosphor with green luminescence.",1
"In this paper, the superplastic deformation of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) was studied at a temperature of 430Â°C (in the supercooled liquid region) under uniaxial tension over a wide range of strain rates from 8Ã10â4 to 4Ã10â2 sâ1. It has been found that the superplastic behavior of the BMG is strongly dependent on the strain rate. The BMG exhibited Newtonian behavior at the low strain rate regime, but became non-Newtonian at the higher strain rate regime. A maximum elongation of 550% was achieved at a strain rate of 2.5Ã10â3 sâ1. On the other hand, structural investigations revealed that plastic deformation could promote the re-ordering and nanocrystallization of the amorphous structure of the BMG. It was also found that a band structure with strongly orientated nanocrystals inside was formed in case of using the high strain rate. The non-Newtonian behavior at the high strain rate regime is discussed in terms of the changes of stress-induced free volume and the concurrent nanocrystallization induced by deformation.",0
"The effect of 0.5, 1.2, and 2.0wt.% Ca additions on the microstructure, thermal stability, and mechanical properties of the cast Mgâ6Alâ0.3Mn alloy (AM60) was investigated. Addition of 0.5wt.% Ca did not form any new phase but suppressed the discontinuous precipitation of the Î²-Mg17Al12 phase by being dissolved in both the second phase and magnesium matrix. In the materials containing higher amounts of Ca, however, the Al2Ca phase with a lamellar morphology appeared in the microstructure and the volume fraction of Î²-Mg17Al12 diminished. It was found that Ca generally refines the microstructure and enhances the thermal stability of the alloy. This was documented by the retention of the initial fine dendritic microstructure, hardness, and ultimate shear strength (USS) of the Ca-containing materials after long-term annealing at 673K. The observed improvements are believed to be caused by the solid solution strengthening of Ca in the Mg matrix, and the particle strengthening effects of the thermally stable Al2Ca phase which are formed as an interconnected network. This behavior is in contrast to that of the base material which developed a coarse grain structure with decreased strength and hardness after the same thermal treatment.",0
"The glass transition has been studied in the ternary systems Ge x/2As x/2Se(1âx), in which the properties of the glass can be tuned from fragile to strong by changing x. In the present work we report on neutron inelastic scattering measurements of Ge x/2As x/2Se(1âx) for x = 0.066. This glass former falls into the category of the so-called fragile glasses. The characteristic dynamic behavior, also observed in other fragile glasses, is primarily characterised by the onset of marked anharmonicity in the low energy spectrum above the glass transition temperature T g. These anharmonic processes have been identified with the fast Î²-relaxation processes, predicted by the mode-coupling theory (MCT). The Q and temperature dependence of the elastic and quasielastic neutron scattering provide information about special features of the glass transition and intermediate range order in this system.",1
"Whisker reinforcement can enhance the thermal shock resistance of coating. Here, a mullite whisker-toughened silicate glass coating for SiC pre-coated carbon/carbon composites (SiC-C/C) was prepared by a molten salt and hot dipping method. The microstructure, interface bonding strength and thermal shock resistance of the coating were investigated. Results show that preparing the buffer mullite whisker layer and incorporating the mullite whisker can effectively improve the coating interface bonding and decrease the size of microcracks. The as-prepared coating has an enhanced thermal shock resistance and the weight loss of the coated samples was only 2.21% after 100 thermal cycles.",0
"Cu54Ni6Zr22Ti18 amorphous materials were prepared using gas atomization, followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The crystallization behavior and mechanical properties were studied using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). With annealing the gas atomized powders to the temperatures of 837Â K and 909Â K, fine particles such as Cu10Zr7 and Cu51Zr14 were precipitated and embedded in the amorphous matrix, respectively. Each size of precipitates at 909Â K is about 50Â nm and 20Â nm, respectively. Microstructural variation and mechanical properties were investigated as a function of the initial powder size and spark plasma sintering (SPS) pressure.",0
"The Monte Carlo method was applied to the study of some metallic magnetic alloys which display spin glass behavior. The energies of the alloys are modelled considering the RKKY interaction among the magnetic moments, and the range of the interaction is controlled by introducing a cutoff radius. In the case of very diluted spin glasses (SG), the spin glass transition is only clearly found when distant next neighbors are considered. In that case of very diluted alloys, the Edward-Anderson order parameter shows that first and second neighbor Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians would not present a SG phase transition. The occurrence of the spin-glass condition is due to the RKKY long-range interaction. The presented Monte Carlo results allows a semi-quantitative prediction of the spin glass freezing temperature.",0
"The Ba2TiSi2O8 is a well known piezoelectric, ferroelectric and non-linear crystal. Nanocrystals of Ba2TiSi2O8 doped with 1.5 Dy3+ have been obtained by thermal treatment of a precursor glass and their optical properties have been studied. X-ray diffraction patterns and optical measurements have been carried out on the precursor glass and glass ceramic samples. The emission spectra corresponding to the Dy3+: 4F9/2 â 6H13/2 (575nm), 4F9/2 â 6H11/2 (670nm) and 4F9/2 â 6H9/2 (757nm) transitions have been obtained under laser excitation at 473nm. These measurements confirm the incorporation of the Dy3+ ions into the Ba2TiSi2O8 nanocrystals which produces an enhancement of luminescence at 575nm. At this wavelength has been demonstrated a maximum optical amplification around 1.9cmâ1 (â¼8.2dB/cm).",1
"In this research, the creation of higher mechanical properties in natural fiber mat composites is proposed. The hybrid jute/glass mat was fabricated by needle-punched system, wherein jute mat was placed on glass mat. The ratio of jute and glass mat layers was set to be 1:0, 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1, respectively. The hand lay-up method was employed to manufacture the composites with unsaturated polyester resin after needle-punched process. Three-point bending test was carried out in order to obtain flexural properties of different composites. The results indicate that flexural strength obtained for jute mat composite (JF) was approximately 37 MPa, whereas high flexural strength was achieved in jute mat/glass mat hybrid composites (JF/GF and JF/JF/GF, when the glass fiber layer is placed as bottom side) that exhibited about respective 61.7 % and 62.0 % higher than the values of JF.",0
"The glasses in the CdNbOF5âBaF2âInF3 system were obtained. The glass structure, thermal behaviour and crystallization were investigated by the IR spectroscopy, DSC, XRD and SAXS methods. The NbO2F4 3â and InF6 3â ions form mixed networks of glasses. For all of the glasses, the cubic phase of CdF2 was found in the crystallization products. Upon heating, the crystalline phase of CdF2 first appeared in the glasses. It was demonstrated that transparent glass-ceramic samples could be obtained by thermal treatment of the glasses in the CdNbOF5âBaF2âInF3 system.",1
"Structure and crystallization kinetics of PbOâB2O3 glasses containing 10â80mol% PbO were investigated. The analyses of IR spectra reveal that PbO causes a change in the short-range order structure of the borate matrix. Between 10â¤PbOâ¤20mol%, PbO only acts as a network modifier. With the increase of PbO content, a progressive conversion of [BO3] to [BO4] units occurs and this promotes the formation of boronâoxygen rings, composed of the connection of bridge oxygen between [BO3] and [BO4] units. When the content is over 60mol%, PbO plays the role of glass former. Four possible structure models have been suggested to explain the effects of PbO on glass network: (a) three coordinated boroxol rings modified by Pb2+; (b) formation of PbOB covalent bands; (c) bridge networks between [BO3] and [BO4] units; (d) complex structures of Pb2+ modified boronâoxygen rings and chains. Moreover, The crystallization kinetics of PbOâB2O3 glasses was characterized by DSC analyses. When PbOâ¥50mol%, the increase of PbO leads to a decrease of thermal stabilities of the glasses. The increase of B2O3 contributes to the increase trends to crystallization of glasses.",1
"A novel Er3+-doped fluorotellurite titanate glasses with the basic molar composition 75TeO2- 5Nb2O5- 5Bi2O3- 5TiO2- 10PbF2, 75TeO2- 5Nb2O5- 5Bi2O3- 5TiO2- 10PbF2- 10000â¯ppm Er2O3 and 75TeO2- 5Nb2O5- 5Bi2O3- 5TiO2- 10PbF2- 20000â¯ppm Er2O3 are explored with respect to possible applications as optical amplifiers. Their thermal and optical features were determined using differential scanning calorimetric (DSC), and UVâVisâNIR spectroscopy, respectively. The glasses transition temperature Tg, factor against crystallization S, optical energy gap and quantum efficiency were determined. Judd-Oflet parameters Î©t (tâ¯=â¯2, 4, 6), branching ratio, Î², fluorescence full width at half maximum (FWHM) of NIR emission, and life time Ï, of I13/2 level have been evaluated. The glasses were characterized by a higher values of FWHM of NIR emission at 1.53â¯Î¼m under excitation by wavelength 980â¯nm with respect to other glasses system doped by single Er3+ions. In the future these glasses can be fabricated as broadband fiber amplifier for the optical communication devices. The glasses studied glasses exhibit green emission under excitation wavelength of 445â¯nm.",1
"Sm3+ -doped oxyfluoride tellurite-tungsten (TWGSm) glasses were prepared by conventional melt quenching method. The optical properties were investigated through photoluminescence excitation, emission and luminescence decay analysis. The optical band gap energy was determined as â¼3.425â¯eV for 1.0â¯mol% of Sm3+ -doped TWGSm glass. Upon 404â¯nm excitation, the TWGSm glasses emit luminescence through 4G5/2â¯ââ¯6H5/2 (563â¯nm), 4G5/2â¯ââ¯6H7/2 (600â¯nm), 4G5/2â¯ââ¯6H9/2 (645â¯nm) and 4G5/2â¯ââ¯6H11/2 (705â¯nm) transitions. The Judd-Ofelt analysis was performed using absorption spectrum and obtained radiative parameters were used to estimate the laser characteristics of present glasses. The concentration of Sm3+ has been optimized as 1.0â¯mol% for efficient luminescence. The luminescence decay of 4G5/2 emission level was studied by monitoring the emission and excitation wavelengths at 600 and 404â¯nm, respectively. The experimental lifetime of 4G5/2 level was decrease with increase of Sm3+ concentration. The 1.0â¯mol% of Sm3+ -doped TWGSm glass could be the best choice for solid state visible lasers to emit orange luminescence.",1
"Transparent Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped zirconium fluoride-chloride (ZFC) glass are firstly prepared for mid-infrared emission. The stronger 2750â¯nm emission from Er3+: ZFC glass is owing to a stronger covalence and local asymmetry of the crystal field around the Er3+ ions. The low phonon energy (600â¯cmâ1) of ZFC glass are calculated from FTIR spectra and confirmed by Raman spectra. The low OHâ concentration (9.75â¯Ãâ¯10â17â¯cmâ3) and high transmittance (1300-4000â¯cmâ1) of ZFC glass are beneficial to mid-infrared emission. Co-doping rare earth ions Yb3+ enhances the 2750â¯nm emission. The energy transfer process between Yb3+ and Er3+ are identified based on luminescence spectra and decay curves. The role of Yb3+ plays the sensitizer on Er3+: 4I11/2 and enhances the excited state absorption of Er3+: 4I13/2â¯ââ¯4F9/2, which is good for transition Er3+: 4I11/2â¯ââ¯4F13/2. Thus, Er3+/Yb3+: ZFC glass with large emission cross section (1.06â¯Ãâ¯10â20â¯cm2) is a potential laser application material.",1
"The objective of this paper was to study glass fiber reinforced cementitious composites (GFRCC) with Portland cement, a high content of fly ash as matrix. The effect of fly ash content, the initial curing time, and accelerated ageing on the flexural strength of GFRCC was investigated. The suitability of the accelerated ageing method was queried by analyzing the results from SEM observation, XRD analysis, and deflection testing.",0
"This work presents a comparative study of different properties variation of Pd40Ni40Si5P15 bulk metallic glass (BMG), namely: density, hardness, relaxation enthalpy and mechanical properties as a function of the sample thickness. The samples were produced in the form of a long pyramid by conventional Cu-mold casting in an Ar atmosphere. The results illustrate significantly different sensitivity of these properties of the glassy phase to the cooling rate. The difference in crystallization behavior is also discussed.",0
"Hollow gold nanoparticles (HGNs) deposited on the surface of transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) glass have been synthesized. The silver nanoparticles were firstly electrodeposited directly on the ITO surface as a template without any organic ligands or surfactants. Then these silver nanoparticles were taken as sacrificial templates and the HGNs were obtained by Galvanic replacement reaction between HAuCl4 solution and silver nanoparticles. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak of HGNs was located at near infrared region of â¼800nm, which was largely red-shifted as compared to silver nanoparticles as a template. Moreover, the refractive index sensitivity of HGNs was enhanced to 277nm per refractive index unit, which was also much higher than that of silver nanoparticles deposited on ITO substrate. The âcleanâ surface of HGNs could be further functionalized by special biomolecules and applied to fabrication of LSPR biosensors. This approach provides a potential opportunity as LSPR biosensors for chemical or biological analysis especially on tissue and blood samples.",1
"We have performed simultaneous measurements of the ac complex resistivity, currentâvoltage characteristics, and current-induced voltage noise of a thick amorphous Mo x Si1âx film in various fields H from zero to high fields near the vortex-glass transition (VGT) H g. We find that the origin of noise changes remarkably as a function of H. Noise is large both in the Meissner and VG phases but falls near or below the background level in the field regions just below and above the VG phase. The former field region is interpreted as an upper bound of a âlower liquid phaseâ intruding between the Meissner and VG phases.",0
"A spin-density-wave (SDW) glass state has been found in Cr alloys. Magnetization measurements in ZFC and FC states have revealed two types of magnetic irreversibility (MI). The first one is caused by a âlocal SDWâ. Depending on the electron concentration of impurity a temperature of divergence of M ZFC(T) and M FC(T), T i, can be either below or above T N. The second type of MI is due to the deformation of the soliton wall of the SDW domains and can be realized only in Cr alloys with an incommensurate SDW structure just below T N.",0
The electronic structure and magnetic properties of Ni2MnGe in the cubic L21 structure are studied using the full-potential non-orthogonal local-orbital minimum basis method (FPLO). The total energy calculations clearly favour the ferromagnetic ground state. The theoretical lattice parameter obtained from the dependence of the total energy on the lattice parameter is in agreement with experimental one. The considerable influence of Mn and Ni 3d electronic states on the formation of the majority and the minority bands of Ni2MnGe are discussed. The pressureâvolume relation is reported. The study of the pressure effect on the electronic structure and the magnetic moment predicted the linear decrease of the total magnetic moment from the ambient pressure to the 19.7GPa.,0
"The first success in the preparation of rare earth hydroxycarbonate thin films has been achieved. Cerium hydroxycarbonate films were prepared by a hydrothermal deposition method, the sample of a single orthorhombic phase was deposited at a lower temperature while those of orthorhombic and hexagonal phases were obtained at higher temperatures. The crystals in the films could be ellipsoidal, prismatic, or rhombic, depending on the deposition conditions applied. The thin films could be candidates for developing novel optical materials and for advanced ceramics processing.",0
"Sb3+/Mn2+ co-doped phosphate glasses were prepared to explore efficient white-light materials. Under 275nm excitation, the emission colors of the samples can vary from blue to red by adjusting Mn2+ ion concentration. The emission color of the sample doped with 2mol% Mn2+ ion is white to the naked eye, and the CIE coordinates (0.336, 0.319) of the sample are close to the standard equal energy white-light illumination (x =0.333, y =0.333). The energy transition efficiency of the sample is about 64.2%. Our research will be helpful in developing white-light materials.",1
"In this study, Tb3+-Yb3+ co-doped transparent oxyfluoride glass-ceramics were prepared respectively from melt-quenched glass samples with the molar compositions of 45SiO2-15Al2O3-12Na2CO3-21BaF2-(7-x)LaF3-xYF3 (xÂ =Â 0, 1, 3, 6 and 7). It was found that the crystal structure of the annealed glass-ceramics strongly depended on the ratio of YF3/LaF3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that the crystal structure transformed from cubic Ba2LaF7 phase to cubic intermediate phase and finally to cubic BaYF5 phase, the BaYF5 nanocrystal was determined as cubic structure instead of the reported tetragonal structure for the first time via a Rietveld refinement method with TOPAS. In the process of crystal structure transformation, the local symmetry around Tb3+ ions was infected by different types of irregularly arranged interstitial F- ions, which further affected the effective phonon energy around Tb3+ ions. The high effective phonon energy around Tb3+ ions in the intermediate phase could strongly enhance the up-conversion (UC) luminescence intensity, and thus improved the UC luminescence efficiency.",0
"In our research, glass was used as a substrate for an H+ ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET). The sensitive characteristics of five structures for separate extended gate ion sensitive field effect transistors (EGFET) were studied. The components included tin oxide (SnO2)/aluminum/micro slide glass, tin oxide/aluminum/corning glass, indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, tin oxide/indium tin oxide glass and tin oxide/micro slide glass. Indium tin oxide (ITO) thin film was first time used as an H+ ion sensitive film, which has a linear pH Nerstern response sensitivity, about 58mV/pH, between pH 2 and 12. In addition, the sensing area effect of the tin oxide/glass, tin oxide/ITO glass and ITO glass structure is discussed. The results show that the tin oxide/ITO glass structure EGFET has the best drift, hysteresis and sensing area characteristics.",0
"Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped fluorotellurite glasses were prepared. Intense green and red upconversion (UC) emissions corresponding to the transitions of 2H11/2, 4S3/2â4I15/2 and 4F9/2â4I15/2 were observed under 980â¯nm laser excitation, benefiting from the advantages of low phonon energy and good stability of fluorotellurite glasses. Temperature-dependent UC luminescence was carried on glasses with different doping concentration of Er3+ in the range of 298â568â¯K. Fluorescence intensity ratios (FIR) and absolute sensitivities (Sa) were calculated, and the maximal sensitivity value of 54.09â¯Ãâ¯10â4 Kâ1 was obtained at 531â¯K in the glass with the lowest Er3+ concentration at 0.1â¯mol%. This study indicates that Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped fluorotellurite glasses can be promising materials applied to non-touching temperature sensors.",1
"The effect of 0.2 at.% boron addition on the microstructure, tensile properties, and creep behavior of Tiâ22Alâ20Nbâ2W were investigated. A TiB phase was observed in the B-doped alloy, which shows that the solubility of boron in this alloy is very low. The addition of 0.2 at.% boron was very effective in reducing the prior Î²-grain size of the Tiâ22Alâ20Nbâ2W alloy, which is thought to be due to a strong boron segregation at the grain boundaries. The decrease in grain size due to the addition of boron is effective in improving the alloy's room temperature ductility. The addition of a small amount of boron was beneficial in lowering the steady-state creep rate at 650Â°C/310 MPa, but did not improve the creep behavior at 750Â°C/310 MPa.",0
"Frequency and temperature dependences of dielectric constant, dielectric loss and ac electrical conductivity were studied for bulk Se70Bi30 and Se70Bi15Te15 chalcogenide glasses, in the frequency range (1â100kHz) and temperature range below glass transition temperatures. Both dielectric constant and dielectric loss are found to decrease with increasing frequency and decreasing temperature. An analysis of dielectric loss data obeyed the Guintini's theory of dielectric dispersion based on hopping model. The ColeâCole diagram has been used to determine some parameters such as the distribution parameter, molecular relaxation time and activation energy for relaxation. The ac conductivity was found proportional to Ïs. The variation of both the frequency exponent and ac conductivity with temperature suggested that, the ac conductivity is explained according to correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model, with activation energy decreasing with increasing frequency for Se70Bi30 and Se70Bi15Te15 samples. The addition of Te atoms leads to an increase in the density of localized states in the tails and consequently increases ac conductivity.",1
"This paper presents the development of glass fibres coated with nanocomposites consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and epoxy. Single glass fibres with different CNT content coating are embedded in a polymer matrix as a strain sensor for composite structures. Raman spectroscopy and electrical response of glass fibres under mechanical load are coupled for in situ sensing of deformation in composites. The results show that the fibres with nanocomposite coating exhibit efficient stress transfer across the fibre/matrix interface, and these with a higher CNT content are more prone to fibre fragmentation at the same matrix strain. A relationship between the fibre stress and the change in electrical resistance against the fibre strain is established. The major finding of this study has a practical implication in that the fibres with nanocomposite coating can serve as a sensor to monitor the deformation and damage process in composites.",0
"The influence of niobium addition on the mechanical properties at high temperature of HP alloy has been investigated. Two HP alloys were centrifugally cast with a similar chemical composition differing only in the niobium content. Low strain rate high temperature tensile tests and creep-rupture tests were performed in the range of 900â1100Â°C, and the results compared between the alloys. According to the results, the high temperature mechanical behavior of both alloys is controlled by several factors like solid solution, network of eutectic carbides, intradendritic precipitation and dendrite spacing. A significant increase in the mechanical properties for the HP alloy with niobium addition was found within the temperature range of 900â1050Â°C. Beyond this temperature the mechanical behavior of both alloys is basically the same.",0
"TiO2 films were heavily doped with W (TiO2:W) by simultaneous rf magnetron sputtering of TiO2, and dc magnetron sputtering of W. The advantage of this method is that the W content could be changed in a wide range. The coexistence of TiO2, WO3 and TiWO5 in the TiO2:W film was detected by XPS analysis. Besides, tungsten in TiO2:W film on the bare glass may form mixed valence of W0+ and W6+. Electrical conductivity was primarily due to the contribution of oxygen vacancies and W donors (WTi ). When the film thickness increased, the TiO2:W film showed higher carrier concentration and higher mobility. Furthermore, the resistivity and the transmission decreased obviously with film thickness. On comparing with the TiO2:W film deposited on the bare glass, the TiO2:W film on the Al2O3-deposited glass exhibited lower surface roughness, lower resistivity, higher optical energy gap, higher optical transmission, and lower stress-optical coefficient.",0
"The nature of the different kinds of magnetic order in the magnetic phase diagram (MPD) of the cubic Dy x Y1âx Al2 weak random magnetic anisotropy series is clarified. At the spin-glass side of the MPD the system is formed by âantiferromagnetic spin-glassâ clusters, with random-sign pair correlations (â 25 Ã size), with randomized net magnetic moments, but correlated over long distances (â103 Ã ) (cluster-glass). At the quasiferromagnetic side, ferromagnetic-like Bragg peaks persist down to x=0.40, but a first-order phase transition at xâ 0.625 signals the borderline for existence of good ferromagnetic order.",0
"The usage of high performance polymeric composites is a valuable alternative to conventional materials due to their high mechanical properties, stiffness to weight ratio and damage tolerance. The Mechanical property of epoxy matrices can be influenced by modifying the molecular architecture and structure, thereby increasing the crosslink density to generate high stiffness and strength. In many of these practical situations, the structures are prone to high impact loads. Material and structural response vary significantly under impact loading conditions. This paper deals with the fabrication and investigation of fiber composites and compares it with GFRP and CFRP used separately. Mechanical behaviour of the composite is obtained by testing the composite laminates for tensile (at varying strain rates and temperatures), flexural (at varying strain rates) and impact. The composite is manufactured by hand layup process. It is found that the CFRP composite has better properties than the GFRP in tensile and flexural. The internal structure of the composite is observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the fractures, voids and fiber delaminating are analyzed.",0
"In a simple self-consistent band model, we calculate the work function change when one adsorbs monolayers of transition metals on tungsten. The work function change with the coverage is in agreement with the experimental results. It shows a maximum for one monolayer and is nearly equal to the difference between the work functions of W and the adsorbed element for a coverage equal to a few monolayers. In all the cases, the charge transfer between the adatoms and the tungsten surface atoms are small. This point allows us to simply calculate the binding energies of the monolayer. The same model is also applied to discuss the diffusion of a monolayer into a bulk transition metal.",0
"Raman spectra and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were used to investigate structure of 27CaOÂ·12Al2O3Â·61SiO2 glass with and without Na2O. A new phenomenon is found: that is, the addition of a low content of Na2O to 27CaOÂ·12Al2O3Â·61SiO2 glass resulting in an increase of the aggregation extent of the glass network. Addition of the Na+ ions to glass leads to the Al3+ ions, existing as network modifiers, further entering as network formers. This results in the decrease of the amount of nonbridging oxygen ions. Al3+ ions located as network modifiers enter as network formers, which corresponds to the highest value of the aggregation extent of the glass network. The nonbridging oxygen ions will re-increase continuously with the Na2O content, which corresponds to the continuous decrease of the aggregation extent of glass network. The most effective content of the Na2O added is about 4.3 mol%.",1
We present the first systematic study of the magnetoresistance and the magnetization of Au Fe in very high field (up to 330 kG) and over a range of concentration from 1.5 to 19 at% Fe. By using these high fields we could estimate the saturation magnetic moment on the iron sites in gold and the total spin disorder contribution to the resistivity at each concentration. The combination of magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements has been a good way to observe the progressive transition from the spin glass state to randomly canted ferromagnetism with increasing iron concentration.,0
"This study evaluated the diametral tensile strength of type I glass ionomer cements and measured their tensile and shear bond strengths to dentin with and without conditioning. Four brands of glass ionomer cement and one brand of zinc phosphate cement were tested. Disks of each cement type were prepared and the 7-day diametral compression test for tension was conducted. The shear and tensile tests, with and without 10% polyacrylic acid dentin conditioning, were performed with an Instron testing machine. Two additional groups, one for each bond test, were prepared and conditioned with 90% trichloracetic acid. No significant differences of the diametral strength were found among the various glass ionomer cements. The comparison of means suggests that, except for trichloracetic acid dentin pretreatment, the conditioning is an effective promoter of shear strength and has no significant effect (p < 0.01) on the tensile bond strength. However, trichloracetic acid was found to be a most effective dentin conditioner for both shear and tensile bond strengths (p < 0.01).",0
"ZnO thin films are widely used as antireflection layer in solar cells and can be grown by various techniques implemented at various temperatures. In this contribution, we present the morphological and optical properties of ZnO thin films prepared by spray pyrolysis on glass substrates at various growth temperatures from 350 to 550Â°C. The surface morphology of the films, analysed by scanning electron microscopy SEM, is modified with substrate temperature. Optical characterizations of ZnO films as a function of temperature were carried out by transmittance and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Main optical properties are as follow: All the films are highly transparent in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The average transmission in the visible range (400â800nm) was greater than 80%. The band gap of ZnO films increases with increasing substrate temperatures attributed to the increase of the grain size of thesample.PL spectrum of ZnO films can be divided into the UV emission and the visible broadband emission attributed to the near band edge emission (NBE) and to the deep level emissions (DLE), respectively. The biggest ratio of UV emission on visible emission of the PL intensity is observed for the ZnO thin film deposited at 550Â°C by the spray pyrolysis technique. Therefore, we suggest that this original result indicate the most suitable growing conditions for obtaining high quality sprayed ZnO thin films with higher luminescence performances.",0
"Purpose To assess the effects of glasses for anisometropia on stereopsis and to determine the factors that affect the level of stereopsis. Design Retrospective observational case series. Methods One hundred six nonamblyopic patients who were wearing glasses for anisometropia and 56 who were wearing glasses for isoametropia were enrolled. The levels of stereopsis in the anisometropic patients were divided into normal (â¤40 seconds of arc), equivocal (40Â < - â¤ 100), and subnormal (100Â < - â¤ 400) and compared with those in the isoametropic patients. It was evaluated whether the amount of interocular difference in the lens power of the glasses, the type of anisometropia, a history of amblyopia, and the age at the time of the prescription of the first glasses were related to the stereopsis. Results In the anisometropia, the mean stereopsis (seconds of arc) was 77.52 (40-200) in the Titmus-fly test and 52.78 (40-100) in the Randot stereotest. The rate of normal and equivocal stereopsis was 87.7% in the Titmus-fly test and 96.9% in the Randot stereotest. The isoametropic patients demonstrated better stereopsis (52.86 and 39.20 in either test) than did the anisometropic patients (P < .05). The stereopsis was worse in the spherical hyperopic type of anisometropia than in the spherical myopic type (P < .05). The level of stereopsis was not related to the other factors that were investigated. Conclusions The level of stereopsis with the wearing of anisometropic glasses was clinically near normal and theÂ glasses did not seriously affect the binocular vision regardless of the severity of the anisometropia.",0
"Al-doped ZnO (AZO) transparent conducting films were successfully prepared on glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering method under different substrate temperatures. The microstructural, electrical and optical properties of AZO films were investigated in a wide temperature range from room temperature up to 350Â°C by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Hall measurement, and UVâvisible meter. The nature of AZO films is polycrystalline thin films with hexagonal wurtzite structure and a preferred orientation along c-axis. The crystallinity and surface morphologies of the films are strongly dependent on the growth temperature, which in turn exerts a great effect on microstructural, electrical and optical properties of the AZO films. The atomic arrangement of AZO film having an wurtzite structure was indeed identified by the HRTEM as well as the Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED). The defect density of AZO film was investigated by HRTEM. The film deposited at 100Â°C exhibited the relatively well crystallinity and the lowest resistivity of 3.6Ã10â4 Î© cm. The average transmission of AZO films in the visible range is all over 85%. More importantly, the low-resistance and high-transmittance AZO film was also prepared at a low temperature of 100Â°C.",0
"Deformation and crack initiation of equiaxed microstructure were investigated using in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM). With Î±s sizes of 0Î¼m and 0.1Î¼m, the cracks initiated along Î±p/Î² and Î±p/Î²tr boundaries (Î±p, primary alpha phase; Î²tr, transformation microstructure), respectively. When the size of coarsened Î± s (Î± s , secondary alpha phase) was about 0.5Âµm, the crack initiated along Î±p/Î² and Î±s/Î² boundaries. The results show that the crack growth was put off by continuous slip across the coarsened Î±s phase. The coarsening of Î±s leads to increase in ductility of the alloy, while it has a slight effect on the strength. Based on the in-situ observations, the morphology of coarsened Î±s was further optimized by heat treatment procedure. According to mechanical tests performed, it was seen that the best property combination could be obtained by adjusting the sizes and morphologies of Î±p and Î±s phases.",0
"The structure and interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of polypropylene-glass fiber/carbon fiber hybrid composites fabricated by a new method called direct fiber feeding injection molding (DFFIM) process were investigated based on the skin-core-skin structure and modified Kelly-Tyson equation, respectively. The fiber dispersion state was evaluated qualitatively by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitatively by the fiber distribution index (FDI). Carbon fiber agglomeration is more likely to occur in hybrid composites and was present in the core layer of DFFIM composites in this study. However, glass fiber has shown relatively uniform dispersion in hybrid composites with a greater tendency to be distributed in the skin layers. This is attributed to the difference in feeding method, where glass fibers were fed through the hopper while carbon fibers were inserted from the vent hole. The IFSS between fibers and polypropylene of different composites in different layers is discussed by considering fiber length and orientation distributions in the core and skin layers, respectively.",0
"Mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCMs) were prepared via a spray drying-assisted template method using resorcinol-formaldehyde as the carbon precursor and water glass as the template. The pore structure could be controlled by adjusting the hydrolysis time, hydrolysis temperature, concentration of the water glass and reactant ratio. Water glass could be recycled after use, making this strategy environmentally friendly and cost-effective. MCMs with three-dimensional interconnected networks, high surface area (852â1549â¯m2 gâ1), large pore volume (1.7â2.1â¯cm3 gâ1) and controllable pore diameter (3.8â15.1â¯nm) were constructed and have good electrical conductivity and a large volume for sulfur loading. The S/MCM composites with abundant residual nanochannels could not only benefit for the diffusion of electrolyte but also improve the utilization of sulfur and buffer the volume expansion of sulfur. The MCMs with relatively small mesopores manifest a high reversible capacity and rate performance owing to the strong confinement effect of polysulfides. MCM-1 delivered an initial capacity of 888.7â¯mAâ¯hâ¯gâ1 under 0.5C with a capacity retention of 700.5â¯mAâ¯hâ¯gâ1 after 100 cycles. The good electrochemical performance confirms that mesoporous carbon microspheres can be an excellent host material for sulfur cathodes.",0
"Undoped and dysprosium doped lithium borate glass system with empirical formula (70âx) B2O3â30 Li2Oâ(x) Dy2O3 (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0mol%) were prepared using the melt-quenching technique. The dosimetric measurements were performed by irradiating the samples to 6MV photon beam using linear accelerator (LINAC) over a dose range of 0.5â5.0Gy. The glass series of dysprosium doped lithium borate glass produced the best thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve with the highest intensity peak from sample with 1.0mol% Dy2O3 concentration. Minimum detectable dose was detected at 2.24mGy, good linearity of regression coefficient, high reproducibility and high sensitivity compared to the undoped glass are from 1.0mol% dysprosium doped lithium borate glass. The results indicated that the series of dysprosium doped lithium glasses have a great potential to be considered as a thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD).",1
"Co2+-doped La2O3âMgOâAl2O3âSiO2 (LMAS) glass-ceramics was synthesized by conventional method. The microstructure of LMAS GCs heat-treated at 760Â°C/12h+930Â°C/4h was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The spectroscopic properties of Co2+-doped LMAS GCs were studied by absorption spectrum, excitation spectrum, and temperature dependent luminescence spectra. XRD results revealed the sizes of MgAl2O4 crystalline phases are about 9.1Â±1.5nm. The three peaks in the visible absorption band of LMAS GCs at 549nm, 585nm and 626nm are connected with the transitions from 4A2 level to 2A1/2T2(2G), 4T1(4P) and 2E/2T1(2G) levels, respectively, and excitations into them emit the radiation at around 666nm. The luminescence intensity increased with temperature increasing from 10K to 150K, while it weakened with temperature increasing from 150K to 350K. These features were explained by the effects of two competing mechanisms.",1
"Intragranular rare earth-rich phases play a vital role in affecting the intrinsic coercivity of sintered Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets. To explore the origin of these intragranular rare-earth-rich phases, the starting material-strip cast Nd-Fe-B flakes were characterized by a variety of high-end microscopy techniques. It was surprisingly found that the intragranular rare-earth-rich phase is spherical in a diameter of ~150â300â¯nm and consists of amorphous regions rich in additive elements (e.g., Cu, Co, and Ga) and crystalline regions which are a combination of hexagonal light-rare-earth-rich phases and body centered cubic phases rich in light and heavy rare earth, and oxygen. Amorphous interfacial layers between the glass/crystal particles and the crystalline matrix were observed, probably due to insufficient time to reach a crystalline equilibrium state. Based on the microstructural observation, we proposed a formation mechanism of these intragranular glass/crystal conjugated particles in strip cast Nd-Fe-B flakes, which may facilitate to minimize the volume of these detrimental intragranular phases during the strip casting process.",0
"This work reports a simple yet highly efficient method to fabricate transparent substrates for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) application. Our technique is based on a fume etching process for commercial ITO-glass (ITO film on glass substrate) with atmospheric fume of hydrochloric acid (HCl). Surface analyses suggested that the spontaneously evaporated HCl molecules chemically reacted with ITO and formed island-like nanostructures. The topography of the ITO surface can be tuned to optimize the SERS efficiency by adjusting the etching parameters. On-line SERS spectra of the R6G solution concentration variation were also obtained to study the adsorption behavior of R6G on ITO surface. This convenient, simple, and low-cost method of making transparent SERS-active substrates potentially opens a way toward rapid, nondestructive and quantitative bioanalysis, particularly in microfluidics.",0
"We demonstrate pulse laser operation of a 4-cm-long Pr3+-doped fluoride-glass fiber laser pumped by InGaN laser diodes (444nm) using an acousto-optic modulator. We obtained maximum laser peak power of 105.6W (2.1Î¼J/pulse) with a pulse width of 20ns at an 8.3-kHz repetition rate for a 607-nm wavelength. Employing a prism tuning cavity, we obtained wavelength tunable Q-switch pulse laser oscillation in the visible region (488â491, 520â526, 601â624, 631â644nm).",1
"The present work explores new methodology of fabricating the polymer nanocomposite with improved interlaminar, dynamic and micro mechanical properties. Varying amount of carbon nanofibers (CNF) were filled into the glass fiber/unsaturated polyester composite using filtering membrane vacuum-assisted method. Microporous nylon membrane was used to improve the dispersion of CNF in the lamination panels. CNF reinforcement and its concentration had a significant effect on the properties of the composites. Electron microscopy studies on delamination and nanofillers dispersion showed improved interfacial adhesion with CNF filled composites. The end-notched flexure and short-beam strength tests were performed to assess the effect of filling CNF on the interlaminar fracture properties of the composites. Existence of critical concentration was observed for the reinforcement of nanofiller. The properties of the composite enhance with increase in reinforcement upto critical concentration, beyond which it decreases. Better storage modulus (â¼57%) and improved interlaminar properties (â¼89%) were consistently observed with 2Â wt% CNF filled nanocomposite irrespective of the glass fiber loading, besides, the thermal stability and char yield which were also improved significantly. Nanoindentation study shows 39% and 26% increase in elastic modulus and hardness of the composite respectively, on reinforcement of 2Â wt% CNF.",0
"The mechanical properties of Mg77Â·5Zn8Â·5Y14 (at%) alloys solidified under various pressures were studied to clarify the effect of the solidification pressure and pressure-induced Mg64Zn15Y21 phase on the mechanical properties. The results showed that hardness, compressive properties were greatly improved simultaneously. The presence of Mg64Zn15Y21 phase increased the ultimate strength, but reduced the elongation. The eutectic and Mg64Zn15Y21 phase coexisted uniformly, this composite structure improved mechanical properties significantly. In addition, the mechanical properties were also affected by the pressure-induced solid solubility change, eutectic spacing and microstructure.",0
"We report on differential thermal analysis (DTA) and dilatometric studies to characterize the thermal stability, kinetics and crystallization processes of a glass with composition 30BaOâ20ZnOâ2.5Al2O3â7.5B2O3â40SiO2 (mol%) (designated as BZAS). The empirical relation between the viscosity of the glass with temperature was calculated by employing the VogelâFulcherâTamman (VFT) equation. Crystallization kinetics was determined under non-isothermal conditions, using the formal theory of transformations for heterogeneous nucleation. The experimentally determined crystallization kinetics was fit to calculate the activation energy for crystallization. Development of crystalline phases on thermal treatments of the glass at various temperatures has been followed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Microstructure and chemical composition of the crystalline phases were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) analysis. Our results suggest that BZAS glass is a thermodynamically stable glass and is derived from a kinetically strong glass-forming liquid. DTA crystallization curve is formed by the overlapping of two exothermic crystallization curves designating two predominant phases, barium aluminum silicate and barium zinc silicate, as revealed by XRD, with activation energies for crystallization of 243 and 195kJ/mol, and calculated values of Avrami constant of 2.05 and 3.07, respectively. However, it is difficult to confirm which of these two phases is first formed as both seem to appear simultaneously.",1
"A series of new glasses of 70TeO2â(20â x) ZnOâxPbOâ5La2O3â2.5K2Oâ2.5Na2O (mol%) doped with Yb3+ is presented. Thermal stability, spectra and laser properties of Yb3+ ions have been measured. It found that 70TeO2â15PbOâ5ZnOâ5La2O3â2.5K2Oâ2.5Na2O composition glass had fine stability ((T xâT g)>190 Â°C), high-stimulated emission cross-section of 1.25 pm2 for the 2F5/2 â 2F7/2 transition and existed measured fluorescence lifetime of 0.94 ms and the broad fluorescence effective linewidth of 72 nm. Evaluated from the good potential laser parameters, this system glass is excellent for short pulse generation in diode pumped lasers, short pulse generation tunable lasers, high-peak power and high-average power lasers.",1
"Ti-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) free from highly toxic elements Ni and Be and noble elements were designed and synthesized in Ti47âxCu40Zr7.5Fe2.5Sn2Si1Scx (xÂ =Â 1, 2, 3 and 4Â at.%) system as potential biomaterials, and the effects of Sc alloying on glass-formation and properties of the Ti-based BMGs were investigated. The Ti-based BMGs containing 2 and 3Â at.% Sc exhibited high glass-forming ability (GFA) and wide supercooled liquid region, and glassy rods with a diameter of 6Â mm could be prepared by tilt-pour copper-mold casting. The Ti-based BMGs possess low Young's modulus of 93â99Â GPa, high yield strength of 1948â2021Â MPa and specific strength of about 3.2Â ÃÂ 105Â NÂ m/kg and plastic strain up to 5.9% under compression, and high Vickers microhardness of 577â590Â Hv. The TiCuZrFeSnSiSc glassy alloys also exhibited good bio-corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. The mechanisms for the effects of Sc addition on glass formation, mechanical properties, corrosion behaviors and biocompatibility of the Ti-based BMGs are discussed. The combination of superior GFA, good mechano- and bio-compatibility demonstrates the potential of the TiCuZrFeSnSiSc BMGs for biomedical applications.",0
"Thin films of europium borate glass have been obtained by pulsed laser deposition. Optical spectra of these films show no indications of the presence of trivalent europium, contrary to the material of the target. Magnetoâoptical activity of the films is demonstrated with the help of magnetic circular dichroism spectra.",1
"An optical temperature sensor based on the upconversion luminescence of Tm3+ has been developed. Under a 980nm diode laser excitation, the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) between 700 (Tm3+:3F2,3 â 3H6) and 800nm (Tm3+:3H4 â 3H6) upconversion emissions from Tm3+/Yb3+ codoped oxyfluoride glass ceramic was studied as a function of temperature in the range of 293â703K. The 3F2,3 and 3H4 states of Tm3+ are verified to be thermally coupled levels. By using FIR technique, the sensitivity for detecting temperature variations achieved here is better than previous reported rare earth ions fluorescence based temperature sensors. With the advantages of intense upconversion luminescence and absolutely separated 700 and 800nm emission bands, the Tm3+/Yb3+ codoped oxyfluoride glass ceramic is a very promising candidate for accurate optical temperature sensors with much higher sensitivity and resolution.",0
"The melting and crystallization behaviors of lithium aluminosilicate (LAS) glasses containing Y2O3 were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and viscosity test. Effects of Y2O3 on the viscosity of LAS glasses were investigated from the softening point temperature to melting temperature. It was indicated that the introduction of yttria effectively decreased the melting temperature and viscosity of LAS glasses. The DTA and XRD results showed that yttria controlled the crystallization of LAS glasses by increasing the crystallization peak temperature (T p) and activation energies (E), and the main crystalline phase of glassâceramics was Î²-spodumene.",1
"Some properties of hydrated cobalt oxides Na x CoO2â yH2O in the superconductor phase are studied using an extended Hubbard model on a triangular lattice. We derive the superconductive ordering temperatures for singlet and triplet symmetries by means of the Greenâs functions of the system, calculated within a combined mean field and Hubbard I type approximation. It is found that both symmetries are possible. The coexistence of d + i d â² and p + i p â² pairing, in a certain doping region, is observed, but the s-extended pairing seems to be the more stable. The critical temperatures for superconductivity are calculated for both symmetries and compared to experimental results.",0
"The measurements of magnetization M ( T ) in bulk SDW alloys Cr 1 - x Co x and ( Cr + 2.7 % Fe ) 1 - x Co x in ZFC and FC states in magnetic field 100Oe with a SQUID magnetometer have revealed two types of magnetic irreversibility (thermal hysteresis between magnetization measured in FC and ZFC states, M FC ( T ) , M ZFC ( T ) ). The first one is observed in alloys with both incommensurate (I) and commensurate (C) SDW structures below the temperature T i much lower than the NÃ©el temperature, T N . It has been explained in terms of a short range SDW order (âlocal SDW'') on the defect. The second one is observed below T i â¼ T N only for Cr alloys with the I-SDW structure. It has been attributed to the mechanism of the SDW phase slip on the defect inside the âSDW soliton wall''. Depending on the field cooled procedure the alloy Cr+1.19%Co with the I-SDW structure shows the first or the second type of magnetic irreversibility, however, if the C-SDW phase is induced by Fe-doping only the first type of magnetic irreversibility can be observed. The temperature dependence of the remanent magnetization, M Rem ( T ) , observed in all studied alloys can be well simulated using the proposed models.",0
"Laser cladding of the Al+TiC alloy powder on Tiâ6Alâ4V alloy can form the Ti3Al/TiAl+TiC ceramic layer. In this study, TiC particle-dispersed Ti3Al/TiAl matrix ceramic layer on the Tiâ6Alâ4V alloy by laser cladding has been researched by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, electron probe micro-analyzer, energy dispersive spectrometer. The main difference from the earlier reports is that Ti3Al/TiAl has been chosen as the matrix of the composite coating. The wear resistance of the Al+30wt.% TiC and the Al+40wt.% TiC cladding layer was approximately 2 times greater than that of the Tiâ6Alâ4V substrate due to the reinforcement of the Ti3Al/TiAl+TiC hard phases. However, when the TiC mass percent was above 40wt.%, the thermal stress value was greater than the materials yield strength limit in the ceramic layer, the microcrack was present and its wear resistance decreased.",0
"The effect of TiO2 additions on microstructure and crystallization of a 42.6 wt% SiO2, 29.4 wt% 3CaOÂ·P2O5, 28.0 wt% MgO glass was studied. TiO2 produced amorphous separation and volume crystallization during ceramming. Heat treatments to 1100Â°C resulted in a simultaneous crystallization of Î²-3(Ca, Mg)OÂ·P2O5 and clino-enstatite (MgOÂ·SiO2) in TiO2-free glasses and the occurrence of a third phase, forsterite (2MgOÂ·SiO2), in all TiO2-containing glasses. Peak crystallization temperatures suggested that crystallization rates increase with TiO2 contents to 3% and that further changes do not occur.",1
"Well understanding about the physical properties of FeTe compound, as a parent of superconducting Fe(Te,âSe) system, is very important for exploring superconducting mechanism in the Fe-based superconductors. Here, based on the transport and magnetization measurements, we report the Cu doping effects on the physical properties of Fe1.05Te compound. We found that in the undoped sample, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition accompanying a semiconductorâmetal transition occurs at 70 K. With the increase of Cu content x, the AFM transition temperature decreases monotonously at first. When x â©¾ 0.05 , both the metallic behavior and long-range AFM ordering disappear. Meanwhile, a spin-glass state emerges at low temperatures. The evolution of the transport and the magnetic properties with the Cu content x is summarized and a phase diagram is proposed. Our results indicate that a local spin picture may be more appropriate than an itinerant model for the Fe1.05Te compound.",0
Mixed glass former effect has been investigated in AgI doped silver borophosphate glasses for the system 0.10AgIâ0.90(0.50Ag2Oâ0.50(xB2O3â(1âx)P2O5)). The network structure of these glasses has been investigated by FTIR spectroscopy. It has been observed that the structural evolution of these glasses with increase of B2O3 content is not similar to that of undoped silver borophosphate glasses. The addition of AgI in silver borophosphate glasses affects the mixed glass former effect. FTIR spectra show that the phosphate glass network is continuously modified in the entire compositional range due to incorporation of B2O3. The network connectivity between the borate and phosphate network depends on the formation of PâOâB linkages and the concentration of three dimensionally connected P3 and B4 units. The compositional dependence of the glass transition temperature depends on network connectivity of the mixed glass formers. The electrical conductivity of these glasses depends on the distribution of different types of anionic site in the glass network.,1
"The present study has been conducted in order to investigate the effect of the surface morphology of SiC inner coating on the bonding strength and ablation resistance of the sprayed ZrB2-SiC coating for C/C composites. The microstructure of SiC inner coatings prepared by chemical vapor deposition and pack cementation at different temperatures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and 3D Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. Tensile bonding strength and oxyacetylene ablation testing were used to characterize the bonding strength and ablation resistance of the sprayed ZrB2-SiC coating, respectively. Results show that SiC inner coating prepared by chemical vapor deposition has a smooth surface, which is not beneficial to improve the bonding strength and ablation resistance of the sprayed ZrB2-SiC coating. SiC inner coating prepared by pack cementation at 2000Â°C has a rugged surface with the roughness of 72.15Âµm, and the sprayed ZrB2-SiC coating with it as inner layer exhibits good bonding strength and ablation resistance.",0
"Dense carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were grown uniformly on the surface of carbon fibers and glass fibers to create hierarchical fibers by use of floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition. Morphologies of the CNTs were investigated using scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Larger diameter dimension and distinct growing mechanism of nanotubes on glass fiber were revealed. Short carbon and glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composites were fabricated using the hierarchical fibers and compared with composites made using neat fibers. Tensile, flexural and impact properties of the composites were measured, which showed evident enhancement in all mechanical properties compared to neat short fiber composites. SEM micrographs of composite fracture surface demonstrated improved adhesion between CNT-coated fiber and the matrix. The enhanced mechanical properties of short fiber composites was attributed to the synergistic effects of CNTs in improving fiberâmatrix interfacial properties as well as the CNTs acting as supplemental reinforcement in short fiber-composites.",0
"We investigated the influence of flux pinning on the behavior of flux lines in a c-axis oriented YBa2Cu3O7âÎ´ thin film, by analyzing the critical scaling of currentâvoltage characteristics at various temperatures under the magnetic field parallel to the c-axis before and after irradiation. In the irradiation process, splayed columnar defects were produced in the film by tilting 200 MeV Au-ion beams off the c-axis by Â±15Â°. The enhancement of the glassâliquid transition temperature and the increment of the dynamic critical exponent z were observed after the irradiation. The depinning model taking into account a distribution of pinning strength can reasonably describe the origin of the changes of both the glassâliquid transition temperature and z owing to the introduction of defects. This fact indicates that the flux line dynamics is governed by the pinning interaction rather than the intrinsic property of the flux line system.",0
"In recent years the researchers are more focused on developing green composite materials using different natural fibers which has found their applications in various industries and automobile sectors. It is also holding numerous advantages such as reusability, recyclability and being eco-friendly in nature. The present work deals with the fabrication of Glass and flax fiber hybrid reinforced composites using modified epoxy resin added with Multi walled carbon nano tube (MWCNT) at different Wt% (0%, 0.5%, and 1%) and evaluate the mechanical properties. The compression molding technique is used to prepare the samples and the MWCNT is incorporated into the epoxy resin by using the ultrasonic probe sonicator. The mechanical properties of the composites are obtained by conducting tensile, compression, flexural, impact and hardness tests as per ASTM standards. The morphological characteristics of the composites such as fiber orientation and fracture, bonding between matrix and fiber are revealed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-rays (EDS) technique. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique is used to identify the crystalline species in the composite material. The result shows a significant improvement in the mechanical properties by incorporating the MWCNT.",0
"Fe-based bulk metallic glasses exhibit very high hardness, elastic modulus/limit and wear/corrosion resistance. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to develop an amorphous coating with Fe48Cr15Mo14Y2C15B6 bulk metallic glass on AISI 4140 substrate by laser surface processing. Following coating, the microstructure and phase aggregate were analyzed by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Microhardness and wear resistance were assessed using Vickers microhardness tester and ball-on-plate wear testing machine, respectively. The coating thickness varied directly with incident laser power and interaction time. Despite trials with wide range of process parameters, the present experiments were unable to retain complete amorphous surface microstructure after laser surface coating. Numerical prediction of the thermal profile and related parameters suggest that the cooling rate and thermal gradient experienced by the coated zone were fairly high. Yet failure to retain amorphous/glassy microstructure of an otherwise bulk metallic glassy alloy suggests that compositional changes (solute redistribution) within the coated zone and across the coatingâsubstrate interface are responsible for nucleation and growth of crystalline phases from the melt. However, correlation between coating parameters and surface microstructure and properties allowed determination of the optimum conditions that ensured fine grained uniform microstructure with a significant improvement in hardness and wear resistance.",0
"Phosphate glasses containing up to 45mol% of niobium were obtained. X-ray diffraction, infrared, Raman, and optical absorption spectroscopy were used to analyze those materials. The refractive index varies from 1.70 to 1.85 as the amount of Nb increases. Niobium phosphate glasses with optical transparence in the (400â2500nm) range were produced. The cut off varied from 342nm to 378nm as a function of the Nb concentration. The cut off is due to the charge transfer O2 âNb5+. Glasses containing 10mol% of Nb2O5 are the most promising materials to be used as rare-earth ions hosts because they are chemically resistant, and show optical transparency in the spectral range of visible to infrared. Doping the glasses with 1â5mol% of Er, Ho, Pr, and Yb ions does not change the glass structure, as measured by X-ray diffraction, infrared, and Raman spectroscopy. The fluorescence lifetimes were determined for Nd, Yb, and Er, and the absorption cross-section were determined for all ions. The energy transfer in co-doped YbâEr system was measured, and the lifetime of excited states and the luminescence efficiency were determined to be 91% for the Er 4I11/2 level, in the YbâEr co-doped glasses.",1
"A TiâNiâCuâZr bulk metallic glass-forming alloy was modified by adding various percents of Ta for improving plasticity. The modified Ti-base alloys are investigated in terms of microstructure, mechanical properties and fracture behavior. (Ti26Zr12Cu53Ni9)0.7(Ti80Ta20)0.3 contains Ti2Ni particles and Î±â²+Î³-TiCu matrix, and exhibits high yield strength and very high Young's modulus, but zero plasticity. (Ti26Zr12Cu53Ni9)0.5(Ti80Ta20)0.5 contains dendritic Î²-Ti(Ta) solid solution and Î±â²+Î³-TiCu matrix, and exhibits high yield strength, high Young's modulus and distinct plasticity, showing significant plasticity-improvement after adding 10 at.% Ta into the alloy.",0
A rare entity that causes congenital mitral regurgitation is an isolated cleft mitral valve. The cleft in the mitral valve can be seen in either the anterior or posterior leaflet of the valve. We present a unique case of an individual with a history of congenital mitral regurgitation caused by a cleft in both the anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve.,0
"In this study, composite plates were manufactured by hand lay-up process with epoxy matrix (DGEBA) reinforced with Kevlar fiber plain fabric and Kevlar/glass hybrid fabric, using to an innovative architecture. Results of the mechanical properties of composites were obtained by tensile, bending and impact tests. These tests were performed in the parallel direction or fill directions of the warp and in a 90Â° direction. FTIR was used in order to verify the minimum curing time of the resin to perform the mechanical tests, and scanning electron microscopy was used to observe reinforcement and matrix fractures. Composites with Kevlar/glass hybrid structure in the reinforcing fabric showed the better results with respect to specific mechanical strength, as well as bending and impact energy.",0
"During service, almost all materials suffer degradation in their properties when subjected to different conditions such as high temperature and moisture. Composite materials are no exception to this general degradation. Here it is proposed to study jute/E-glass fiber reinforced polymer composite at different temperatures with varying humidity conditions. The composite materials are tested for tensile and flexural properties at ambient conditions and in wet-hot conditions. Influences of these variables on microstructure of these composite materials are studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is found that tensile strength of the composites that have undergone treatments mentioned above is reduced which assigns the absorption of water molecules on the surface which weakened the composites.",0
"Using the mixed powders of the gas-atomized Ni-based metallic glassy alloy powder blended with metal W or ceramic SiC particulates, we fabricated large-size bulk glassy alloy composites (GACs) by a spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the prepared GAC specimens were investigated, and the effect of addition amount of the crystalline particulates on the properties of the sintered GAC specimens was discussed. The Ni-based bulk GACs with ultrahigh strength and enhanced plasticity were produced. The improvement of plasticity of the fabricated bulk GACs is attributed to the structural inhomogeneity caused by the addition particulates inclusion. The optimum content of the crystalline particulates is about 5â10 vol.%.",0
Ductile crystalline phases of bcc Ta and CuZr(B2) were coupled in situ and assembled in a coreâshell structure in bulk metallic glass (BMG) composites through controlled inoculation. These two phases were dispersed homogeneously within the amorphous matrix. The CuZr(B2) phase nucleated preferentially on the bcc Ta surface following well-defined crystallographic orientation relationships. A layer of intermediate transition zone containing interwoven amorphous structures formed at their interfaces to lower the interfacial energy. The composites exhibited significantly improved plasticity and simultaneous increase in strength. This study greatly aids in the microstructural design and tailoring for optimized mechanical properties of BMG composites.,0
"We picture the viscosity and Î±-relaxation time of a supercooled liquid as Arrhenius-like at temperatures well above the melting point, and as superArrhenius, i.e., describable in terms of a temperature-dependent activation free energy, E(Tâ), at temperatures near the glass transition temperature, T g. We discuss this in terms of a superArrhenius factor Î(T g)=[E(T g)âE â]/T g, where E â is the activation free energy at high T. We relate Î(T g ) to the property called âfragilityâ, and discuss its relation to non-exponential relaxation and to activated dynamics. We postulate that supercooled liquids are broken into supermolecular domains, frustrated phase-related entities which are to be distinguished from species-specific local clusters.",0
"The effect of BaO concentration contained in the barium sodium borate glass samples are focused as a main study in this research. Sm3+-doped Ba-Na-B glasses were prepared by melt-quenching technique with the chemical composition xBaO:25Na2O:(74.5-x) B2O3:0.5Sm2O3 (where x = 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol%). The highest emission light yield occurs when exciting the samples with 400 nm (corresponding to the 6H5/2â6P3/2 transition). The emission spectra of the glass samples observed with 400 nm excitation wavelength showed the emission bands centered at 562, 600 and 646 nm assigned as 4G5/2â6H5/2, 6H7/2 and 6H9/2 transitions, respectively. The color of the emitted light, calculated by emission spectra with the CIE 1931 color space of all glass samples were shown in orange. The result showed that the BaO concentration contained in glasses have the effect on the emission light yield and 10 mol% of BaO in glass was the optimum.",1
"We report the first valence manipulation of a rare-earth ion, samarium, in a transparent glass by an infrared femtosecond laser and a 4-dicyanmethylene-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) dye laser. Absorption and photoluminescence spectra showed that some of the Sm3+ ions in the focus of the laser beam within the glass sample were reduced to Sm2+ ions after femtosecond laser irradiation. The laser-reduced part was further irradiated by the DCM dye laser at 680nm. Persistent spectral hole burning was observed at 680nm in the excitation spectrum. The observed phenomenon could be useful in the fabrication of optical memory devices that can store data in both space and wavelength axes as well as micro-optical devices.",0
"The microstructure and mechanical properties of (Zr-Ti)1- ÏNiÏ(ÏÂ =0,Â 1, 3, and 5Â wt.%) alloys were studied. With the addition of nickel (Ni), the phase composition of alloys changes from Î± phase to Î± phaseÂ +Â hexagonal close packed (hcp) C14 Laves-phase. The thickness of lamellar Î± phase decreases with increasing Ni content. Optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results indicated that C14 Laves-phase is formed on the boundary. The Zr-Ti-3wt.%Ni alloys exhibits better ultimate compressive strength and compressive plasticity (1715Â MPa and 9.70%) than that of Zr-Ti alloys (1598Â MPa and 12.40%). The decrease of the average thickness of the lamellar Î±-phases (from 0.183Â Î¼m to 0.065Â Î¼m) leads to the improvement of the strength of the alloy. Additionally, the solid solution strengthening and the second phase strengthening are also important reasons for the improvement of the strength.",0
"It is highly desirable to develop efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting. We herein report a rational design for reliable and convenient fabrication of a set of nanocomposites with ZnIn2S4 nanosheets encapsulated UiO-66 octahedral nanoparticles (UiO-66@ZnIn2S4). The comprehensive characterizations verify ZnIn2S4 nanosheets are uniformly decorating on UiO-66 octahedral nanoparticles. The systematic studies demonstrate the UiO-66@ZnIn2S4 (U@Z) holds favorable features to facilitate effective separation and transfer of photochemical charges, thanks to intimate contact interfaces and a well-matched band structure between UiO-66 and ZnIn2S4. The optimal nanocomposite exhibits high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production under visible light illumination, generating hydrogen at an impressive rate of up to 3061.61â¯Î¼molâ¯hâ1â¯gâ1, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 9.84% under the incident monochromatic light of 420â¯nm.",0
"Glasses with the composition of 37.5SiO2â25AlPO4â12.5Al2O3â(25â x)CaOâxPbOâ0.5Bi2O3 (x =0â25mol%) were fabricated. Near infrared (NIR) emission located at 1260 and 1100nm were observed when excited by 808 and 690nm LD excitation, respectively. Significantly enhancement of NIR emission at 1260nm has been realized by PbO introduction. Furthermore, compared with that of sample without PbO, the intensity of NIR emission located at 1110nm form sample with 25mol% PbO increases by a factor of 1.2, meanwhile red emission of Bi2+ decreases by a factor of 18. We propose NIR emissions located at 1260 and 1100nm originate from Bi+ and Bi0, respectively, and PbO incorporation induce the forming of Bi+ due to the better radius match between Pb2+ and Bi+.",1
"B11 NMR spectra have been used to study the structure of glasses in the system K2Oî¸B2O3î¸P2O5. The results indicate that the glasses do not contain an appreciable number of boron atoms in BO3 units with one or two non-bridging oxygens. The fraction N 4 of boron atoms in BO4 units is measured and analyzed according to a structural model containing the following elements. (1) If the binary borophosphate system forms glasses, they consist of a borophosphate (BPO4) network and a borate network for K<1, or a borophosphate (BPO4) network and a phosphate network for K>1, where K = mol.% P 2 O 5/mol.% B 2 O 3. (2) The conversion rates of BO4 units (i.e. the rate of production or destruction by added oxygens) in the borate network and the borophosphate (BPO4) network are given as (+2) and (â0.38), respectively. (3) K+1 ions are proportionally shared between the two networks; (i.e. between the borate and borophosphate (BPO4) networks for K<1, and between the phosphate and borophosphate (BPO4) networks for K>1).",1
"Phase separation and nucleation processes in MgOî¸Al2O3î¸SiO2î¸TiO2 glass during heat treatment at a temperature in the range 580â800 Â° C were investigated by means of differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering. It was discovered that in the glass heat treated at a temperature lower than its glass transition temperature T g, the phase separation proceeded and the largest value of the nucleation rate occurred; that the temperatures of maximum nucleation rate become lower with the extension of the heat-treatment time; and that the larger the radius of gyration of the lower viscosity phase (TiO2-rich) in the glass, the better the nucleation.",1
"The glass transition characteristics of poly(aryl ether ketone ketone) (PEKK) have been investigated as a function of backbone structure and crystallization history; PEKK 100 0 homopolymer and PEKK 70 30 and 60 40 copolymers were examined, where the numbers represent the terephthalic/isophthalic (T/I) ratio. For the all-para-connected homopolymer, the presence of crystallinity had a significant influence on the calorimetric glass transition properties of the amorphous phase: T g was offset by as much as 20Â°C in the crystallized samples as compared to the wholly amorphous material, and a sizeable (W RAP â¼ 0.30) rigid-amorphous-phase fraction was observed. In the copolymers, crystallinity had only a very minor effect on T g. The rigid-amorphous-phase fraction in the copolymer samples was smaller as compared to the homopolymer, and was negligible (W RAP â 0) for samples prepared under less-restrictive crystallization conditions. Dielectric studies indicated progressive mobilization of the rigid-amorphous-phase fraction above T g for the copolymer samples, with full mobilization of the non-crystalline fraction observed for those samples crystallized at the highest temperatures. These results show that the introduction of 1,3-connected isophthalate moieties in the PEKK copolymers has a disrupting influence on the persistence of crystalline constraint into the amorphous phase. Similar observations have been reported for poly(phenylene sulfide) copolymers and thermoplastic polyimides that incorporate meta-phenylene linkages in the chain backbone.",0
"The proportion of composites, mainly glass and carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) in the material cycle have been increasing for years in many sectors. Landfilling of FRP waste is forbidden and recycling is still an unsolved issue. Aim of this paper is the investigation of a feasible reuse of FRP as reinforcement in concrete as shredded material or as thermally recovered plain carbon fibres. A huge amount of glass fibre polymer waste is generated in the wind energy sector and shows low alkaline resistance which is not directly applicable as a reinforcement in alkaline concrete without any surface protection. Therefore, different surface treatments were conducted: on the one hand the aim is to protect FRP fragments in concrete and on the other hand to improve the adhesion. The results of pull-out tests show that a sanded surface of glass fibre polymers increases the averaged maximum shear strength by 16 %. Investigation of the influence of different volume contents (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 Vol.-%) of recycled, pyrolized carbon fibres with a varying fibre length show a maximum flexural strength at 1 Vol.-% in bending tests on fibre reinforced concrete. Compared to plain concrete an increase of +111 % can be observed.",0
"The glass powder is a waste resulting of the manufacturing process of flat glass (regular glass). This study evaluates the eco-efficiency of cement production using glass powder residue as partial replacement of cement. The glass powder residue (GPR) was used as partial replacement up to 50% by weight in cement pastes to evaluate the potential use of this matrix for application in fiber cement composites. For mortar specimens, the percentage of substitution of cement (up to 20% by weight) was used to evaluate the applicability of the glass powder in masonry construction. Primarily, several experiments such as thermogravimetric analysis, compressive strength tests, pozzolanic activity and durability tests were carried out to evaluate the potential use of GPR in cement industry. Secondly, to evaluate the eco-efficiency of the material elaborated, the energy demand of cement partially replaced by glass powder residue and the energy performance of mortars were calculated using mathematical equations. The results showed that GPR presents a pozzolanic activity and a free calcium hydroxide cement matrix is obtained when the ordinary Portland cement is partially replaced by 50% by weight of GPR in cement pastes. Moreover, the partial replacement of cement by 10% by weight of GPR leads to an increase of physico-mechanical properties of mortars. Finally, the energy consumption per MPa of mortars partially replaced by GPR (10 and 20% by weight) is lower than the one of original Portland cement suggesting the eco-efficiency of GPR for applications in cement production and the elaboration of cementitious materials. According to the results of the study, the residue from polishing process of flat glass can be used for the elaboration of green cement and eco-efficient cementitious materials.",0
"A new series of Ti40Zr10Cu36âxPd14Gax (xâ¯=â¯2, 4, 8 and 10) alloys with improved plasticity and glass-forming ability (GFA) are produced. The strategy is to create local structural heterogeneity in Ti-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) by alloying with a soft element which has high negative enthalpy of mixing with Ti-atoms. The GFA of Ti40Zr10Cu36âxPd14Gax rods increases with increasing Ga content up to 4â¯at.%, and for more Ga it decreases. Minor addition of Ga (xâ¯=â¯2) is beneficial to improve the strength and ductility of the TiZrCuPd-based BMG due to the formation of local structural heterogeneities which facilitate the formation of a highly organized pattern of multiple shear bands under quasi-static compression. Ti40Zr10Cu34Pd14Ga2 BMG shows the best combination of compressive global strain and maximum compressive strength of â¼4.5% and â¼2000â¯MPa, respectively. Comparing the Young's modulus of Ga-containing alloys in amorphous and crystalline state we find that the amorphous state shows significant elastic softening (40â48% smaller) which is useful to reduce stress shielding effect for biomedical applications. The alloys show a remarkable thermoplastic formability as the viscosity decreases sharply by an order of magnitude in the supercooled liquid region.",0
"High Erbium-doped glass showing the wider 1.5-Î¼m emission band is reported in the Bi2O3âB2O3âGa2O3 system and its thermal stability and optical properties such as absorption, emission spectra, absorption and stimulated emission cross-sections and fluorescence lifetime are investigated. Compared with other glass hosts, the gain bandwidth properties of high Er3+ content in BBG glass are better than those of tellurite, germanate, silicate and phosphate glasses. The broad and flat 4I13/2â4I15/2 emission and the larger stimulated emission cross-section of Er3+ ions around 1.5Â Î¼m enable it to be used as a host material for potential broadband optical amplifiers at C and L bands in the microchip configuration.",1
"A novel charge-trapping-type MOS memory structure using a high-k dielectric on a thin SiO2 layer, both fabricated in a single electrochemical step, was demonstrated. The high-k dielectric was a porous anodic aluminum oxide layer (Al2O3, PAA) that played the combined role of the charging medium and the control oxide. The tunnel oxide was an electrochemical SiO2 layer grown through the pores of the anodic alumina layer. It was demonstrated that this simple MOS structure shows comparable memory characteristics (charging/discharging, memory window and retention) with those of charge trapping type memories using high-k dielectrics in a complicated gate dielectric stack, fabricated using expensive equipment. It could be a solution towards a novel low cost charge trapping dielectric layer for memory devices.",0
"In situ deformation experiments were performed in a transmission electron microscope to investigate the mechanical properties of submicron-sized Pd40Cu30Ni10P20 metallic glass (MG) wires. Results show that the submicron-sized MG wires exhibit intrinsic ultrahigh tensile strength of â¼2.8GPa, which is nearly twice as high as that in their bulk counterpart, and â¼5% elastic strain approaching the elastic limits. The tensile strength, engineering strain at failure and deformation mode of the submicron-sized MG wires depend on the diameter of the wires.",0
"In this study, a laminated woven bamboo/woven E glass/unsaturated polyester composite is developed to combat a ballistic impact from bullet under shooting test. The aim of this study is to understand the fundamental effects of the woven bamboo arrangement towards increasing ballistic resistance properties. The work focusses on the ballistic limit test known as NIJ V50, which qualifies materials to be registered for use in combat armor panels. The results show that the composites withstood 482.5â¯m/s Â± 5 limit of bullet velocity, satisfying the NIJ test at level II. The findings give a strong sound basis decision to engineers whether or not green composites are qualified to replace synthetic composites in certain engineering applications.",0
"The conduction in pure and 2% Zn substituted GaV4S8 has been studied by means of moderate as well as high DC fields and AC fields upto 1 MHz. Ï(Ï, T) shows a typical temperature scaling, characteristic of hopping conduction in disordered solids. At low temperatures, these compounds show non-linear IâV characteristics and a negative differential resistance in rather moderate fields. The results are analysed using Mott's variable range hopping relations and are found to give consistent parameters like localisation length, density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level and conduction bandwidth except for an unreasonably large value of the phonon assisted transition rates. The result that the conductivity exhibits all the elements of a variable range hopping is interpreted to support the thesis that a Wigner glass state exists among the electrons localised on the V4 clusters.",0
"The effects of heat treatment on the microstructures, crystallization kinetics, mechanical performance, and anti-corrosion behavior of a hypoeutectic Zr68Al8Ni8Cu16 bulk metallic glass (BMG) were studied. Through annealing, the precipitated phases were crystalline Zr2Cu and Zr2Ni. The total crystallinity was determined to be 10% and 77% for the samples annealed at 673â¯K and 713â¯K, respectively. The partial crystallization of the alloy leads to a dramatic deterioration in the ductility as compared to the as-cast BMG. Furthermore, the decrease in the ductility was accompanied by an increase in the crystallinity. The as-cast Zr-based BMG exhibited a greater corrosion resistance in the HCl solution than that of the annealed alloy. The depletion in the Zr and Al cation fractions of the surface oxidation film, which resulted from the precipitation of reactive nanocrystalline phases from the glassy matrix, is responsible for the reduced corrosion resistance.",0
"The dependence of mean atomic volume and the glass transition temperature on the average coordination number, Z, have been examined for glasses of the GeSb(As)Se systems, in the light of recent models proposed for network glasses. The results indicate the occurrence of additional features at Z values other than the topological thresholds of â 2.40 and â 2.67. These additional features are attributed to effects of chemical ordering. The occurrence of these features in addition to those due to the two topological effects, namely, the floppy to rigid transition and the structural transition, leads to the conclusion that the effects of the chemical ordering and the effects which topological origin coexist in these glasses.",1
"The fast relaxation in glass-forming substances is often identified with the Î²-relaxation of the idealized mode coupling theory (MCT), which involves a critical temperature, T c, higher than the glass transition temperature, T g. However, several recent experimental works indicate that the fast relaxation may not be so simply described. These findings include the breakdown of the predictions of the idealized MCT below T c in 0.4Ca(NO3)2â0.6KNO3 (CKN) and ortho-terphenyl (OTP), the existence of the fast relaxation also in crystalline OTP, and the flat dielectric susceptibility minimum (i.e., nearly frequency independent or constant loss) observed in CKN and propylene carbonate at temperatures below T c. These experimental facts indicate that the fast relaxation observed below T c is outside the predictions of the idealized MCT and a recent two-component schematic model of MCT, which includes hopping. It is unlikely that this non-MCT fast relaxation existing below T c will abruptly vanish at temperatures above T c. The need for an alternative model of the fast relaxation not only below but also above T c is thus clear. We analyzed susceptibility spectra of many glass-formers with the assumption that the susceptibility minimum is caused by a temperature dependent near constant loss. Good fits to the susceptibility spectra were obtained and in the process the near constant loss was determined as a function of temperature. When compared in a plot against T g-scaled temperature, the near constant losses of different glass-formers exhibited a pattern that correlates with the stretch exponent, Î² Î±(T g), of the KohlrauschâWilliamsâWatts (KWW) function which describes the time dependence of the structural Î±-relaxation at T g. The correlation suggests that the fast relaxation and the slow structural Î±-relaxation are both determined by the same factor, which we attribute to the anharmonic intermolecular potential of interactions between the molecules. The fast relaxation is suggested to be the relaxation of a vibration by anharmonicity. The vibration is likely the one that attempts to relax the structure of the glass-former.",1
"Dysprosium doped Ge x Ga5Se(95âx) (x =15â30) chalcogenide glasses were synthesized in this present work. The VisâNIR transmission spectra, photoluminescence spectra and lifetime were measured. Glasses (x =27.5, 29.17 and 30) doped with 0.2wt% dysprosium ions shows relatively strong emission bands at 1146 and 1343nm when pumped at 808nm. The emission lifetime ranged from 440 to 540Î¼s. The oscillator strengths and intensity parameters Î© t (t =2, 4 and 6) were calculated using JuddâOfelt theory.",1
We investigate the stability of the replica-symmetric solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick(SK)-Ising spin glass in a transverse field. It is shown that the replica-symmetric solution is unstable in the whole lowtemperature phase. The low temperature behaviour is investigated by applying the first stage of replicasymmetry breaking to the present model.,0
"Long lasting phosphorescence (LLP) was observed in Eu2+, Ce3+ co-doped strontium borate glasses prepared under the reducing atmosphere due to the emission of both Eu2+ and Ce3+. The methods of photoluminescence, thermoluminescence and phosphorescence were used to study the samples, and possible mechanism was suggested. The co-doping of Ce3+ ions poisoned the phosphorescence emission of Eu2+ because of the competition to obtain the trapped electron. The phosphorescence of Ce3+ in the sample decays more quickly than that of Eu2+, which is suggested for the reason that the emission energy of Ce3+ is higher or the distance between Ce3+ and electron traps of the glasses is longer.",1
"Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped lead silicate glasses with superior thermo-mechanical and chemical properties are synthesized. Efficient 2.0Î¼m emission of Ho3+:5I7 â 5I8 sensitized by Er3+ ions from the prepared glasses is obtained under 980nm laser diode pumping. Energy transfer mechanism between Er3+ and Ho3+ is analyzed. According to the absorption spectra, Judd-Ofelt parameters, spontaneous transition probability and radiative lifetime have been calculated and discussed. Absorption and emission cross sections have also been calculated and analyzed. The maximum emission cross section is 4.2Ã10â21 cm2 around 2.0Î¼m. The gain coefficient reaches 2.1cmâ1 at 2.018Î¼m. These results ensure that the Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped lead silicate glasses have potential applications in mid-infrared wavelengths and can obtain high gain in fiber lasers.",1
"This paper presents a preliminary investigation on the effects of incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNT) into polyamide-6 (PA6) on mechanical, thermal properties and fire performance of woven glass reinforced CNT/PA6 nanocomposite laminates. The samples were characterized by tensile and flexural tests, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), heat distortion temperature (HDT) measurements, thermal conductivity and cone calorimeter tests. Incorporation of up to 2wt% CNT in CNT/PA6/GF laminates improved the flexural stress of the laminates up to 36%, the thermal conductivity by approximately 42% and the ignition time and peak HRR time was delayed by approximately 31% and 118%, respectively.",0
"The results of comparison of spectral position of the LF bands of g-As2S3 and g-As22S78 with theoretical calculations of vibrational spectra of different clusters (As2S4, As2S5, As2S6, AsS3âAs3) in the LF region (10â85 cmâ1) are given. The torsion type vibrations of the small chain-like clusters are located in the same spectral region as Boson peak of AsâS glasses system. They can make several contributions to the LF spectrum. The cluster lengths by weight distribution functions f(L)*L are from 5.5 to 10.1Ã and from 4.5 to 7.5Ã for g-As2S3 and g-As22S78, respectively. The lognormal fittings of the f(L)*L functions give the most probably values about the 7.6Ã (for g-As2S3) and 6.2Ã (for g-As22S78).",1
"Several blends of PEG 6000 â SR 33557 (those with a glass transition detected on cooling: 20â30 wt% PEG 6000) were heated at different heating rates, Î². Solidification depends on both the cooling rate (Î±) and the mixture composition. A glass transition was detected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in mixtures containing drug (SR 33557) >60 wt%. The dependence of the glass transition temperature, T g, on the heating rate is analyzed using an empirical relationship of the kind T g =A+B lnÎ² and the activation energy concept. The parameter B is nearly a constant, 1.7Â±0.2 blends with drug content >60 wt%. Activation energies obtained were 370Â±35 kJ/mol for the drug and 250Â±20 kJ/mol for the mixture with 20 wt% excipient. Moreover, the effect on T g of cooling rate is analyzed. In samples cooled at different rates and heated at the same rate, the glass transition temperature increases as previous cooling rate increases.",0
"A series of Cs-borosilicate glasses of general formula (mol%): 17.5Na2Oâ2.5Cs2Oâ45SiO2â(35-x)B2O3âxCaO, where x varies from 0 to 10, were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique. Physicochemical properties like glass transition temperature, extent of volatilization loss of Cs and chemical durability of these glasses have been investigated in detail. Based on the T g values obtained from DSC studies, it is confirmed that the glass network remains unaffected with increase in CaO content in the glass at the expense of B2O3. Cs loss as function of duration of heating revealed that the Cs evaporation follows diffusion controlled mechanism and the extent of loss increases with the increase of CaO incorporation in glass. Chemical durability of the glasses has been found to improve significantly with in the increase of CaO content in glass and this has been attributed to the formation of Ca and Si rich layer at the outer surface of the glass, as inferred from SEM with EDX analysis.",1
"We report on angular dependent measurements of the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for YNi2B2C single crystals near the glass phase transition, By varying the angle Î¸ between the external magnetic field and the ac-plane, the critical exponents are extracted for all orientations. At small Î¸, the data agrees well with the vortex-glass model. No evidence supports the existence of correlated disorder.",0
"Cu47Ti34Zr11Ni8, (Cu47Ti34Zr11Ni8)99Si and (Cu47Ti34Zr11Ni8)99Al bulk metallic glass were prepared by copper mold casting method, and the thermal stability, mechanical properties and microstructures of them were studied. With minor alloying of Si and Al additions, the glass transition temperature (T g), crystallization temperature (T x1) and temperature interval of supercooled liquid region ÎT x (=T x1-T g) and reduced glass transition temperature (T rg) were proved to be changed from 672 K, 734 K, 62 K, 0.575 to 691 K, 752 K, 61 K, 0.592 and to 681 K, 729 K, 48 K, 0.590, respectively. The results indicate that the glass-forming ability (GFA) are improved with minor alloying additions. And the bulk glasses also exhibits high three point-bending flexural strength. Because of the additions of Si and Al, three point-bending flexural strength and flexural modulus of the bulk glass change from 2 350 MPa, 102 GPa to 3 260 MPa, 102 GPa and 2 970 MPa, 108GPa respectively. The obvious strengthening is due to the appearance of the medium-range ordered regions with a size of 2â5 nm under the high-resolution TEM image. The reason that the mixed amorphous and nanocrystalline phases caused by minor alloying of Si and Al additions, is that Si or Al is the third kind of elements, which are different from other constituting elements, and there are a strong bonding and atoms size effects between constituting elements, which cause the glass-forming ability (GFA) and the bulk metallic glasses strength improving.",0
"The present study compared the compressive, tensile and flexural strengths of 26 commercial glass ionomer cements, which were evaluated 24 h after the beginning of the setting reaction. In order to give a global estimation of their overall strength, a coefficient was attributed to each glass ionomer cement. This strength coefficient provided a ranking of the tested materials. The highest scores were obtained by the restorative glass ionomers; however, these materials exhibited lower mechanical properties than the more classic restorative materials such as amalgams or composites. The results also showed a large scattering of the mechanical properties among the luting and lining glass ionomer cements. The creep behavior of the glass ionomer cements was also investigated.",0
"In this study, silane coupling agent 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (CTS) was used for improving the distribution of water glass (WG) in the polyurethane (PU) matrix and increasing the crosslinking density of PU/WG grouting materials. The optimum dosage of CTS and the pretreatment time of WG were investigated. The effect of CTS on the surface property of WG and the fracture morphology of the PU/WG composites was studied by contact angle measurement and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The effect of CTS on the mechanical properties of PU/WG grouting materials was systematically studied by compression test, fracture mechanical test, flexural test and dynamic mechanical analysis. The introduction of CTS in the PU/WG grouting materials improved the surface property of WG, the homogeneous distribution of polysilicate particles in PU matrix, the compressive property of PU/WG composites by 11.65â40.65%, the fracture toughness by 9.68%, the fracture energy by 21.33%, the flexural strength by 6.60%, the flexural modulus by 15.85%, and the dynamic mechanical properties of the composites. A possible mechanism of the functions of CTS in the PU/WG grouting materials was proposed.",0
"Metallic glasses (MGs) usually exhibit synchronously enhanced plasticity and strength with decreasing the testing temperature. Although great efforts have been made, why MGs show better plasticity at low temperature remains unclear. In this work, the shear band cracking and fracture mechanism of a relatively brittle TiZr-based MG was investigated through methods of low temperature compression and 3D X-ray tomography. Pronounced apparent softening and profuse internal shear-band cracks were observed along with the improved plasticity, enhanced yield strength, decreased average softening rate, and reduced area of vein pattern as decreasing the testing temperature. Moreover, the fracture features can be correlated well with the compressive properties; and the true rupture stress that is carried by the still-bonded part of major shear band was found to be very close to the yield strength, demonstrating that the apparent softening should mainly originate from the cracking rather than dilation of shear band. The decreased softening rate can be fitted by a diffusion model, implying reduced atomic mobility and increased cracking resistance. Consequently, the improved plasticity of TiZr-MG at low temperature was attributed to the suppression of instant fracture and the enhanced resistance to shear band cracking, rather than the change of shear band density.",0
"GeSe2 and Ge28Sb12Se60 chalcogenide glass thin films have been deposited on single crystal silicon substrates by vacuum thermal evaporation. The surface morphology of these films has been investigated by field emission-scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, revealing heterogeneities in their microstructure consisting of granular regions â¼15â50nm in size, which were coarser in the case of the GeSe2 films. Typical RMS film surface roughness values were â¼0.9â1.3nm.",1
Neutron inelastic triple-axis spectra of CD3OD/6% D2O in the glassy and liquid phases are reported. Both the dispersion and damping of the sound modes show characteristic features as the temperature is lowered down into the glassy regime. Also the analysis of the observed scattering intensities evidences the presence in the glass of a second component centered at zero frequency which is not observed in the liquid.,0
"The effect of substitution of Ni for Cu on the glass forming ability and mechanical properties was studied in Mg65Cu25â x Ni x Gd10 (x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25) alloys by thermal analysis and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). With increasing x from 0 to 25at.%, the glass transition temperature, T g, of Mg65Cu25â x Ni x Gd10 alloys increases from 417 to 450K, and the onset temperature of crystallization, Tx , decreases slightly, resulting in a decrease in the supercooled liquid region. However, an appropriate substition of Cu by Ni (5at.%) in Mg65Cu25Gd10 significantly improves mechanical properties, especially improves the ductility of Mg-based bulk metallic glass (BMG) while keeping good glass forming ability (GFA). The Mg65Cu20Ni5Gd10 BMG sample of 5mm in diameter is fabricated by the conventional Cu-mold casting method in an argon atomsphere.",0
"FTIR spectra of three MgOâPbOâB2O3 glass series have been analyzed. There is a decrease in the fraction N 4 of four coordinated boron with increasing the MgO content, at the expense of PbO. A new technique has been presented to make use of the N 4 data and follow the change in the modifier and former fractions of PbO and MgO. These fractions change markedly, at different rates, with the glass composition. The fraction of modifier MgO is always less than the MgO content, which suggests a former role of this oxide in the studied glasses. The ability of the glass to include MgO increases with increasing PbO content.",1
"This research paper reports about the change in optical spectra of alkali aluminoborate glasses under high dose of gamma irradiation. Effect of irradiation on visible spectra finds remarkable applications in optoelectronic materials. Glasses with a host matrix composed of M2O (where M=Na, K), Al2O3, B2O3 were prepared by conventional melt quench technique. Gamma irradiation was performed at a dose-rate of 573Gy/h to a total dose of 50kGy. Samples were characterised before and immediately after irradiation by UVâvis transmission spectra in the range of 200â800nm. The induced absorption coefficient and loss of transmission due to irradiation were attributed to the nature of alkali metals as well as the host matrix.",1
"The formation, structure and properties of clustered glassy alloys were reviewed in correlation with pseudo-high entropy (PHE) type alloy components on the basis of our recent data. The features of the PHE bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) in Fe- and Zr-based alloy systems were also presented in comparison with high entropy glassy and crystalline alloys. The selection of PHE alloy compositions enables the formation of a clustered glassy phase in the wide temperature range below the onset temperature of the second exotherm peak. The presence of the glassy phase without appreciable precipitates even after the completion of the first exotherm peak has not been reported so far in spite of a large number of crystallization data on amorphous and glassy alloys. The precipitates at the temperatures just below the second exotherm peak for PHE Fe- and Zr-based glassy alloys are big cubic Ï-FeCoNiCrMo(B) with a lattice parameter of about 0.90Â nm and Zr2M (MÂ =Â Al,Fe,Co,Ni,Ag) with a lattice parameter of about 1.2Â nm, respectively. The precipitation of these metastable phases with large unit volumes needs long-range atomic rearrangements, but the atomic diffusivity in the PHE glassy alloys is very low, resulting in the formation of the clustered glassy phase. The clustered glassy alloys exhibit high strength and unprecedented plasticity for PHE ZrâNbâAlâNiâCu BMGs, very high coercive force for Nd-Fe-Al BMGs, good soft magnetic properties in conjunction with better plasticity for PHE FeâBâSiâPâCu BMG and high thermal resistance to crystallization for PHE ZrâAlâNiâCuâAg BMGs, and hence are expected to become important as a new type of engineering glassy material.",0
"Glass formation and its relation to the dendritic and eutectic growth has been investigated for the La100â x [Al0.412(Cu,Ni)0.588] x (x=30â56.3) and La86â y Al14(Cu,Ni) y (y=16â29) alloy systems. The experimental results show that in the La-rich pseudo ternary LaâAlâ(Cu,Ni) system, optimum glass formation actually occurs at an off-eutectic composition. A nearly fully amorphous rod with 12 mm in diameter can be obtained at an off-eutectic composition near La62Al15.7(Cu,Ni)22.3, while only a 1.5 mm diameter rod can be obtained fully amorphous for the eutectic alloy La66Al14(Cu,Ni)20. A strong dependence of GFA on the composition is observed for these alloys. In addition, formation of a composite (i.e. Î±La dendrite reinforced glass matrix) in 12 mm diameter cast rods is observed over a wide range of composition, including the eutectic composition. It has been found that the GFA does not correlate well with the extent of the undercooled liquid region (ÎT x) and is not even closely related to the reduced glass transition temperature (T rg). These unusual observations in glass formation and its relation to the skewed eutectic coupled zone have been explained in terms of the competition between the growth of crystalline phases (i.e. eutectic and dendritic phases) and the formation of the amorphous phase.",1
"This research addresses the dynamic compressive properties of flax fibre reinforced polymer (FFRP) and glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) confined concrete under impact loadings. The investigations were performed by conducting impact tests using a high-speed servo-hydraulic machine, with the impact-induced strain rates ranging from 0.2Â sâ1 to 30Â sâ1. Plain concrete (PC), FFRP-PC, and GFRP-PC specimens were tested. The influences of FRP confinement and strain rate on compressive strength, stress and strain time histories were studied. The failure processes of the specimens were analysed via evaluating the high-speed camera photographs. The empirical relationship between the corresponding dynamic increase factor (DIF) of compressive strength and strain rate for PC, FFRP-PC and GFRP-PC were proposed based on experimental data. Experimental results of FFRP-PC and GFRP-PC specimens were compared to assess the confinement effectiveness of the FRP.",0
"Statement of problem Dental fractures can occur in endodontically treated teeth restored with glass fiber reinforced posts and cast gold posts. Purpose The objective of this study was to record the fracture strength of endodontically treated teeth restored with glass fiber reinforced or cast gold post and cores cemented with 3 cements. Material and methods Forty-two single-rooted premolars with standardized weakened roots were endodontically treated and allocated to 6 experimental groups (n=7) defined by the 2 factors investigated: post system and cement. Three groups were restored with glass fiber posts and resin-modified glass ionomer cement, dual-polymerizing resin cement, or chemically active autopolymerizing resin cement. The other 3 groups were restored with cast gold post and cores and the same 3 cements. The cores of the glass fiber post groups were fabricated with composite resin core material. Metal crowns were cemented on the cores in the 6 groups. The entire system was subjected to continuous compression in a universal testing machine, and fracture limit and location (cervical third, middle third, or apical third) were noted. Two-way ANOVA and the ScheffÃ© test were used to analyze the data and compare the groups (Î±=.05). Results Two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in the post type (P<.001) and the cements (P<.001). The interaction between them (P<.001) was statistically significant in the fracture resistance of the endodontically treated teeth. The greatest interaction between post and cement was the glass fiber post with resin-modified glass ionomer cement, followed by the cast gold post and core with resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Conclusions The use of a glass fiber reinforced post and resin-modified glass ionomer cement increased the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth.",0
"In the present work, Eu2+/Eu3 +âYb3+ co-doped SiO2âK2OâBaF2âLa2O3âSb2O3 oxyfluoride glasses were synthesized by conventional melt quenching method to elucidate the cooperative energy transfer (CET) based frequency down conversion from Yb3+ ions under UV excitation. The in situ formation of divalent europium (Eu2+) along with Eu3+ during high temperature synthesis of these glasses under ambient atmosphere has been perceived and was explained through optical basicity model. Frequency down-conversion due to emission of two near infrared photons at around 1Î¼m from Yb3+ ions has been realized upon excitation of Eu2+ ions under 286nm and further enhancement of this frequency down-conversion has been observed upon ceramization of these glasses. The precipitation of BaF2 nano-crystals in glassâceramics causes reduction of Eu3+ ions to Eu2+ ions resulting in an enhancement in the cooperative energy transfer from Eu2+ to Yb3+. The weak contribution of Eu3+ excitation towards Yb3+ emission has been attributed to the cross-relaxation process via 5D0 â 7F6 (Eu3+):2F5/2 â 2F7/2 (Yb3+) route. The donor (Eu2+/Eu3 +)âacceptor (Yb3+) concentration has been optimized at 0.5mol% Eu2O3 and 1.0mol% Yb2O3 to achieve maximum down-conversion intensity near 1Î¼m.",1
"The magnetic susceptibility of hydrogen-doped Zr67Co33 metallic glass has been measured at temperatures between 1.7 and 100K for various dopant concentrations. The system is paramagnetic with magnetic susceptibilities that are only weakly temperature dependent down to about 25K, below which a slight increase can be observed. It has been found that Ï(100K) decreases substantially with increasing hydrogen content. This behaviour is primarily attributed to reductions in the density of the Fermi level electronic states. The form and magnitude of the observed anomalous temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility are in agreement with recent electron interaction theories, which predict quantum corrections to the susceptibility. Hydrogen has been found to influence strongly the quantum-mechanical interference at defects, thus slowing down the spin diffusion and enhancing the susceptibility at low temperature.",0
"We report an excellent tensile property of the Mg-based nano-dual-phase glass-crystal alloy in sub-micro size. It shows room temperature large ductility (>50% true strain, resulted from the localized necking deformation) with ultrahigh tensile strength (2.4Â GPa), compared with 1.4Â GPa strength and limited ductility of its metallic glass counterpart. To unraveling the underlying reasons, we have made transmission electron microscope (TEM) in-situ tensile investigation and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for the materials, showing that homogenous plastic flow of nano-sized metallic glass phase activated by strain non-localization mechanism is responsible for the large ductility.",0
"Binary and ternary copolymers of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(ethylene-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate) (PEN) and poly(p-hydroxybenzoic acid) (PHB) were synthesized and dynamic mechanical measurements at temperatures ranging from â140Â°C up to the melting point were performed. A linear dependence of the glass transition temperature of the isotropic materials on composition was obtained. Copolymers containing more than about 30 mol% PHB are partly liquid-crystalline, and those containing more than 50 mol% PHB are completely liquid-crystalline. The PET/PEN/PHB ternary copolyester containing equal parts of each of the three components can be obtained at room temperature as a liquid-crystalline glass and as an isotropic glass, depending on thermal history. The glass transition temperature T g of the material in the liquid-crystalline state was found to be about 30Â°C lower than that of samples in the isotropic state. By extrapolation to 100 mol% PHB, a glass transition temperature of about 120Â°C was estimated for the PHB homopolymer. Samples containing more than 70 mol% PHB show an additional peak in tan Ï, which is attributed to a relaxation process in a disturbed hexagonal crystalline phase. At temperatures below T g in all copolymers investigated several Î² relaxation maxima were observed. The temperature positions of these maxima do not depend on the composition.",0
"Novel formulation for dry powder inhalation (DPI) particularly appropriate for very dilute drug concentration was developed based on the pressure swing granulation (PSG) technology. PSG was applied to the granulation of excipient lactose particles and to the coating/dusting of lactose granules with fine model drug particles. Size distribution and granule strength as well as the dispersibility of the drug particles for DPI were found to be successful for practical use. The drug particles dispersed into the respirable aerodynamic size range of 1â7 Î¼m from the E-halerÂ® was 53.9% for 1% coating/dusting (i.e. 1% drug in product granules) and 46.3% for 2%. E-halerÂ® was capable of emitting 89.8% and 83.2% of drug particles charged for cases for 1% and 2% coatings, respectively.",0
"Flexible and robust amino-functionalized glass fiber filter paper/polyaniline (A-GFFP/PANI) composite films were fabricated as free-standing tensile-tolerant electrodes for high performance supercapacitors, by facile in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline on the surface of glass fiber filter paper (GFFP) in sulfuric acid solution, after surface modification. The results showed that the surface modification of GFFP with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane played a role as bridge for connecting the polyaniline and glass fiber, resulting to unique polyaniline (PANI) coating and subsequently better electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance and electrical conductivity of the A-GFFP/PANI-1 electrode, which was fabricated via the conventional chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline with concentration of 0.18mol/L, were 391.3F/g and 2.78S/cm, while the A-GFFP/PANI-2 electrode, prepared via rapid-mixing chemical oxidative polymerization under the same preparation condition, possessed the specific capacitance and electrical conductivity of 490.6F/g and 1.83S/cm. The capacitance retention of the A-GFFP/PANI-2 electrode (106. 8%) was also better than that of the A-GFFP/PANI-1 electrode (98.0%) after 2000 CV cycles at a scan rate of 100mV/s, also owing to the bridging function of the functional silane. The A-GFFP/PANI-2 electrode retained 72.6% of its initial specific capacitance under the stress of 0.70MPa for 1h, indicating its good tolerance to tensile.",0
In order to study the local proton motion in complex perovskite-type protonic conductors anelastic and dielectric relaxation measurements have been carried out on the compound Ba3(Ca1.18Nb1.82)O9âÎ´ . Both techniques show spectra depending on the proton concentration. From the dielectric measurements an activation energy of E a=0.50 eV for the local reorientation of a proton-related defect can be derived. The observed anelastic spectra support the assumption that the same type of defect gives rise to an anelastic relaxation peak. The concentration dependence and comparison with long-range conductivity data are discussed.,0
"This article deals with the suitable use of waste glass in polymer anchor materials based on the epoxy resin. The research focused on the effect various waste glass had in different amounts on specific anchor-material properties. Various tests were conducted such as the specification of tensile properties, thermal resistance, monitoring the temperature during a polymerization process and a pull-out test. Test results assessment led to choosing a formulation that would yield the best quality of the polymer anchor.",0
"RÃ©sumÃ© La compression du nerf fibulaire commun (NFC) par des kystes arthro-synoviaux de lâarticulation tibio-fibulaire supÃ©rieure est rare. Deux formes macroscopiques peuvent se rencontrerÂ : les kystes extraneuraux et les kystes intraneuraux. Ã la revue de la littÃ©rature, nous nâavons trouvÃ© que 3Â cas pÃ©diatriques de paralysie du NFC secondaire Ã des kystes extraneuraux pour soixante cas environ rapportÃ©s chez lâadulte. Profitant de lâhistoire clinique de deux enfants opÃ©rÃ©s de cette maladie, nous revenons sur cette entitÃ© rare dont le diagnostic et la prise en charge doivent Ãªtre rapides. En effet, mÃªme dans le cas dâune atteinte clinique et Ã©lectro-physiologique sÃ©vÃ¨re, une rÃ©cupÃ©ration clinique complÃ¨te est possible comme lâillustrent nos 2Â observations.

Two macroscopic forms may be encountered: extraneural cysts and intraneural cysts. In a review of the literature, we found only three pediatric cases of common peroneal nerve palsy due to extraneural cysts and about 60Â cases reported in adults. Taking advantage of the clinical history of two children operated in our department for this disease, we describe this uncommon entity, which must be diagnosed and treated rapidly. Even in the presence of severe clinical and electrophysiological symptoms, a full clinical recovery is possible, as observed in these two children. However, follow-up is needed because recurrence is possible.",0
"A large quantity of resources consumed by the construction industry and the resultant pollution has inspired the need to study eco-friendly materials, such as kenaf fibers, that can be used for construction applications. Kenaf fibers were used to reinforce cement by fabricating fiber reinforced cement composites that exhibited outstanding mechanical and thermo-physical properties. A considerable interest has arisen in investigating the use of natural fiber to replace synthetic fiber for different composite products to alleviate the environmental impact from the traditional construction materials. In order to evaluate the environmental performances of glass fiber reinforced cement wall panels and kenaf fiber reinforced cement wall panels, this study conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) on the fiber reinforced cement wall panels between kenaf fiber and traditional glass fiber. The structural function and thermal insulation function of the wall panels were considered as two separate functional units. The LCA results showed that the environmental impact could be significantly reduced using kenaf fiber to replace glass fiber as reinforcement in the cement wall panels in regards to both structural and insulation functions. The major contribution to the environmental impact for the fiber reinforced wall panels was from cement and the production of the cement raw materials. Kenaf fiber significantly reduced environmental impact, which can be a viable eco-friendly material to replace glass fiber for the construction industry.",0
"Calcium aluminosilicate glasses with small percentages of silica have been prepared. The limits of glass formation at 1600Â°C were found to expand as silica is added to calcium aluminate base compositions. The behavior of such physical properties as glass transition temperature and transition range viscosity has indicated that the structural role of silica changes as its concentrations is increased, keeping the CaO/Al2O3 ratio constant.",1
"Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP) have been proven to be adequate substitutes for steel reinforcement under aggressive environments for flexural Reinforced Concrete (RC) elements. Their mechanical properties, basically their lower modulus of elasticity, derive in larger crack widths and deflections, in particular when Glass-FRP (GFRP) bars are used. Moreover, their different bond behaviour, mainly due to their mechanical properties and different surface configurations, make necessary to assess the available equations to determine crack width need to be assessed. This paper presents a study on the cracking behaviour of GFRP RC elements based on the results of an experimental programme involving 15 beams. The paper studies the influence of the reinforcing material, Ï/Ïeff ratio, concrete cover, stirrup spacing and bond between the concrete and the reinforcement. For this purpose, two different types of GFRP and steel bars were used. The cracking behaviour (crack width and spacing) in the pure bending zone was analysed up to the service load. Crack width was consistently acquired by using a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. The 2D full-field displacements of the pure flexural zone were registered using 4 digital cameras and commercial software that enables the evolution of the specimen cracks to be analysed. Finally, bond coefficients have been adjusted to different formulations in terms of crack spacing and crack width.",0
"The glass transition temperature of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) with poly(vinylacetate), poly(methylmethacrylate) and various poly(acrylates) have been obtained over the whole composition range. The effect of the size of the side-chain group upon the miscibility has been found to be important, leading to partial miscibility for the blends with poly(n-butylacrylate) and poly(methylmethacrylate). On the other hand, the solvent from which the blend is cast has a noticeable effect on the composition dependence of the glass transition temperatures. Finally, the composition dependence of the glass transition temperatures of miscible blends has been correlated in terms of some lattice models.",0
"In this work, we report the magnetocaloric properties of a hexagonal intermetallic compound Pr2Ni0.95Si2.95 that exhibits spin cluster glass behaviour below 3.3â¯K. At lower temperature, the compound undergoes magnetic field induced metamagnetic transition beyond 5â¯kOe applied field value as inferred from the temperature dependence of magnetization at various fields as well as isothermal magnetization measurements. The temperature dependence of magnetic entropy change ( â Î SM) has been calculated from the magnetization data and the maximum value is found to be 7.9â¯J/kg-K for a magnetic field change of 70â¯kOe. Interestingly, although the compound does not undergo any long range magnetic ordering, it exhibits considerable magnetocaloric effect in a temperature region much above the spin freezing due to the presence of short range magnetic correlation that persists up to much higher temperature. The suppression of short range interaction with the application of magnetic field has been argued to be responsible for such magnetic entropy change and adiabatic temperature change over a large temperature scale.",0
"Broadband near-infrared emission has been investigated in a new type host composition of Er3+âTm3+ codoped germanate glass. A broadband emission extend from 1350 to 1675nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) around 138nm is obtained in the germanate glass which codoped with 0.2 wt.% Er2O3 and 0.8 wt.% Tm2O3. The energy transfer between Er3+ and Tm3+ plays an important role in the emission mechanism, which is evidenced by the visible upconversion and the lifetime of Er3+:4I13/2 level effected by the addition of Tm2O3. And energy transfer efficiency from Er3+ to Tm3+ reaches 76% for the highest Tm3+ concentration of 0.8 wt.%. These results suggest that this glass would be a promising material for broadband light source and broadband amplifier for the wavelength division multiplexing transmission systems.",1
"Glass-fibre-mat reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites have been manufactured with spatially-graded distributions of fibre content. Flexural and impact tests were carried out to investigate the effect of these fibre distributions on the load-direction-dependent mechanical properties of the composites. Isotropic composites with uniform fibre content distribution through the specimen thickness were also prepared for comparison with the spatially-graded composite. When the face of a sample with high glass fibre content was loaded, the flexural strength and the impact energy of the composite showed improved values by comparison with those of the isotropic composite. On the other hand, poor flexural strength and impact energy were observed when the face of the sample with low fibre content was loaded. Finite-element analysis was performed to investigate the stress/strain distribution of the deformed model structure with the variation of moduli through the thickness. Despite having the same fibre content, the glass-fibre-mat/PP composites could have the characteristic mechanical properties with different spatial distributions of fibre content.",0
"A novel erbium ion doped zinc fluoride glass was prepared. 2.7Î¼m emission and transmittance properties together with thermal ability were investigated. An enhanced 2.7Î¼m emission was observed by introducing ZnF2 in the ZrF4-based fluoride glass. Meanwhile, the J-O parameters and branching ratios (Î²) of Er3+-doped zinc fluoride glass were calculated and analyzed. The present Er3+-doped zinc fluoride glass with large emission cross-section (0.92Ã10â20 cm2) and long decay lifetime (2.05ms) at 2.7Î¼m indicates that it have very promising applications for solid state lasers around 3Î¼m.",1
"Structural, magnetic, resistivity and thermal transport measurements have been performed to study the Mo-doping effect on a layered cobaltite Ca3Co4âx Mo x O9 ( 0 â¤ x â¤ 0.4 ) system. The results indicate that the low-temperature magnetic behavior of the system changes from a ferrimagnetic state to a spin-glass-like state upon Mo doping, which is due to the decrease in the average valence of Co ions. Moreover, all the Mo-doped samples have a higher resistivity and larger thermopower S compared with the Mo-free sample. The variation in the resistivity and thermopower between the Mo-doped and the Mo-free samples is dominated by the change in the carrier concentration of the samples. In the Mo-doped samples with x â¥ 0.1 , both the resistivity and thermopower decrease gradually with increasing Mo-doping level, which is suggested to mainly originate from the variation in the carrier mobility of the samples. In addition, an obvious thermopower upturn is observed in the S ( T ) curve of all the Mo-doped samples, which can be explained by the enhancement of spin-fluctuation induced by Mo-doping.",0
"Bulk chalcogenide glasses spanning a range of compositions have been measured for their nonlinear index of refraction (n 2) and two-photon absorption (Î± 2) at 1.3 and 1.55 Î¼m, using the Z-scan technique. The figure of merit, T, was calculated for each glass and used as an indication of potential of these glasses for all optical switching applications. Selected samples have been deposited as films, using techniques elaborated herein, to form channel waveguides and the results of initial measurements of self-phase modulation (SPM) in these samples are reported.",1
"A tough polyethersulfone (PES) membrane was utilized as a novel reinforcement to improve impact performance of a carbon/glass hybrid composite. The hybrid composite was made of a glass fibre/epoxy block that was sandwiched between two carbon fibre/epoxy blocks. The PES reinforced hybrid composite was compared with an unmodified hybrid composite and a glass reinforced aluminium (GLARE) laminate. During impact testing, results showed that incorporation of PES led to an increase in toughness with a reduction in damage propagation in the investigated composite panels. Furthermore, the results showed that for low impact energy levels (6â¯J, 12â¯J and 18â¯J), the addition of the PES membrane reduced the area of damage by an average of 67%, compared to the virgin laminate. By increasing the impact energy level (24â¯J and 32â¯J), fibre breakage was the dominant failure mode and the PES had a negligible effect on the impact performance. A comparable load bearing performance was observed with the hybrid composites and the GLARE laminate for the low energy levels (6â¯J, 12â¯J and 18â¯J). However, the GLARE laminate had a better performance during high energy impacts (24â¯J and 32â¯J), due to the high ductility of the aluminium plates.",1
"Novel Eu3+ doped mayenite glass phosphors with Eu element homogeneously doped and high transparency were successfully synthesized by aerodynamic levitation method. The transmittance reached as high as 88% from the visible light up to 6Âµm in the mid-infrared wavelength. Under the excitation of 254nm (charge transfer), 393nm (Eu3+, 7F0â5L6 transition) and 464nm (Eu3+, 7F0â5D2 transition), glass phosphors emitted strong red luminescence with 615nm (5D0â7F2 transition) predominant in the emission spectra. Differences of decay lifetime in excitation wavelengths and Eu dopant concentrations could be ascribed to the non-radiation relaxation process and luminescent concentration before the quenching effect. Furthermore, Eu doped mayenite glass could also emit red light at 615nm (5D0â7F2 transition) under the X-ray excitation. Therefore, the high transparent C12A7: Eu glass phosphors could be promising candidates for solid state lighting, X-ray radiation detection, and even transparent displaying in the visible and mid-infrared ranges.",1
"Er3+ has been considered one of the most suitable sensitive ions of Ho3+ to generate 2â¯Î¼m emission. In this work, luminescent properties and energy transfer mechanism of Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped lead silicate glass were systematically investigated under 980 and 1550â¯nm excitations, respectively. Based on the absorption spectra, the Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters, absorption and emission cross sections, and gain coefficient were calculated. The emission cross section of Ho3+: 5I7 â 5I8 transition is as large as 8â¯Ãâ¯10â21â¯cm2. And the calculated maximum gain coefficient is 3.48â¯cmâ1â¯at 2010â¯nm. In addition, the energy transfer efficiency between Er3+: 4I13/2 level and Ho3+: 5I7 level can reach 89.3% when the samples were pumped by a 980â¯nm laser diode. An intense 2â¯Î¼m emission was obtained upon excitation of 1550â¯nm due to the large absorption cross section of Er3+ at 1550â¯nm and efficient energy transfer from Er3+: 4I13/2 level to Ho3+: 5I7 level. These results suggest that the Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped lead silicate glass has great potential for application as a mid-infrared laser material.",1
"Luminescent properties of Ce/Tb/Eu co-doped calcium borosilicate glass were investigated through excitation and emission spectra, fluorescence lifetimes and colorimetric analysis. The spectra results show that the concentration quenching of Eu3+ ions occurs when the concentration of Eu2O3 ranges from 0.75mol% to 1.00mol% and Ce3+, Tb3+ and Eu2+ ions are all the donors which can transfer energy to Eu3+. It can be indicated from the analysis of lifetimes that through nonradiative transition, Tb3+ ions can accept energy from Eu2+ ions and also transfer energy to Eu3+ ions. Furthermore, the colorimetric analysis show that the correlated color temperatures (CCT) of Ce/Tb/Eu co-doped calcium borosilicate glass can be adjusted from cold white to warm white by controlling the concentration of Eu2O3.",1
"Mould filling patterns and moulding faults are examined in injection moulding of unfilled, short-glass-fibre (up to 1 mm) filled, long-glass-fibre (up to 10 mm) filled and rubber-modified short-glass-fibre filled polypropylene by adopting short-shot mouldings. Fibre-reinforced polypropylene is found to be much more susceptible to jetting and to suffer from weld-lines. Jetting is assessed at different injection temperatures, injection speeds and mould gate sizes. The anisotropy in fibre alignment, resulting mainly from jetting, has considerable effect on impact strength, tensile strength and on a mechanical damping term, tan Î´. This effect is accentuated by fibre volume concentration and fibre length.",0
"We present experimental results on the structural relaxation dynamics of a fragile molecular glass, propylene carbonate, from quasielastic neutron and inelastic light scattering investigations of the supercooled liquid. The data show the power law and the scaled dynamics predicted in recent mode-coupling theories for the glass transition. As expected, the critical behaviour occurs at a temperature much higher than the calorimetric glass transition temperature. The relaxation is found to be considerably stretched despite the high probe frequencies (GHz) and there is no indication of any crossover to exponential decay. This is in contrast to the single relaxation time behaviour expected at short relaxation times/high frequencies in phase-space models and also contrary to the reported general behaviour of simple glass-formers. Comparing with data of ionic glass-formers of similar fragility we conclude that there is no simple relation between nonexponentiality of the relaxation decay and degree of fragility as has been suggested.",0
"Mg-3.4Nd-0.1Zn-0.40Zr alloy samples with and without containing gadolinium (0.6%, mass fraction) were prepared by sand casting. The aged hardening behavior, solidification microstructures and mechanical properties of the alloys were investigated by using the analysis methods of OM, XRD, TEM, hardness tests and mechanical property tests. The main research results are as follows. 1) Compared with the alloy without the addition of gadolinium, the alloys with the addition of gadolinium shows the more remarkable age-hardening response. 2) The as-cast microstructure of the alloy with and without containing gadolinium consists of Î±-Mg grains with Mg12Nd phase on the grain boundary. After solution heat-treatment, Mg12Nd phase of the alloy without containing gadolinium is dissolved in the matrix, however, there is still discontinued Mg12Nd phase at grain boundary of the alloy with containing gadolinium. The more finely dispersed precipitates in Mg matrix are formed in the alloy with containing gadolinium during age-treatment. 3) The room temperature and high temperature mechanical properties of the alloy are satisfactory, with Ïb=280 MPa, Ï0.2=165 MPa at RT and Ïb=215 MPa, Ï0.2=155 MPa at 250 Â°C. The high temperature mechanical properties decrease slightly with the increase of temperature.",0
"The transition temperature T c and isothermic magnetization are calculated as functions of applied magnetic field in the frame of the 2D XY Josephson glass model. Three characteristic regions are shown to be distinguishable in the H-T plane: the diamagnetic region, region of superconducting glass and region of Josephson spin glass. The results are in qualitative agreement with experimental data and the results of numerical simulations for ânewâ superconductors.",0
"Molybdenum particles were injected into a plasma flame within an atmospheric environment, melted and accelerated to impact on a glass substrate. Contiguous splats are formed on substrates maintained at 340 and 480Â°C. Grain structure of the oxygen-enriched molybdenum splats was observed with optical microscopy and scanning electronic microscopy. It was found that dendrite grains align along the splat rim towards the center, suggesting that solidification is initiated at the periphery of melt splat. The solidification starts after the splat has reached its final diameter. The grains in the central portion of the splat are predominantly equiaxed, indicating melt undercooling prior to solidification. The physical process associated with grain structure formation is discussed.",0
"The pre-crystallization kinetics of Pb10Se90 glass was determined under non-isothermal conditions using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. Two isoconversional methods, the KissingerâAkahireâSunose and Vyazovkin methods, were used to determine the variation of the activation energy for glass transition with temperature. The results show that only one (three-dimensional growth) mechanism is working simultaneously during the amorphous-glass process of the investigated glass.",1
"Ho3+/Yb3+ codoped lanthanumâtungstenâtellurite (TWL) glasses are prepared by melt-quenching method. The JuddâOfelt intensity parameters (Î©t t =2, 4, 6), radiative transition rates, radiative lifetimes, and branching ratios of Ho3+ are calculated based on the absorption spectrum to evaluate the spectroscopic properties of Ho3+ in TWL glass. The mid-infrared emission of the samples are investigated under the excitation of 980nm LD. The absorption, emission cross-sections and gain coefficient of Ho3+:5I7 â 5I8 are calculated. The energy transfer processes of Yb3+âYb3+ and Yb3+âHo3+ are analyzed, the results show that the Yb3+ ions can transfer their energy to Ho3+ ions with large energy transfer coefficient, and a maximum efficiency of 84%.",1
"ODS-310 austenitic steel (Feâ25Crâ20Niâ0.35Y2O3â0.5Ti) was fabricated by the process of mechanical alloying and hot isostatic pressing. Plastic deformations, including forging and hot rolling, were applied to the as-hipped samples to improve the ductility. Microstructural evolutions in samples under different fabrication conditions were characterized by TEM. Tensile properties were tested at 23Â°C and 700Â°C. Dispersed oxide particles with sizes between 10nm and 50nm were characterized to be rich in YâTiâO. UTS and elongation of the as-hipped sample were 904MPa and 11% respectively at 23Â°C. Elongation increased two times after plastic deformations while there was only slight decrease in strength properties.",0
"After giving an introduction to spin glasses, I will discuss recent numerical results on two topics which have been of interest in the field for many years: (i) whether there is a finite temperature phase transition in isotropic vector (e.g., Heisenberg) spin glasses, and (ii) whether there is a phase transition (called the AT line) in a spin glass in a magnetic field.",0
"Glasses and glass-ceramics with nominal composition 73 TeO2â 4BaOâ 3Bi2O3â18SrF2-2RE2O3 (where REâ¯=â¯Eu, Dy) have been synthesized by conventional melt-quenching technique and subsequent heat treatment at 370â¯Â°C for 24â¯h in air atmosphere. Various Eu3+ to Dy3+ molar ratio have been applied to investigate luminescence properties in both glass and glass-ceramic matrices. Especially, white light emission through simultaneous excitation of Eu3+ and Dy3+ has been studied in detail. Influence of crystalline SrF2 phase on luminescence kinetics has been determined by luminescence decay time measurements. Presence of crystalline SrF2 phase has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction technique XRD and transmission electron microscopy TEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR have been applied to get further insight into structural properties of glass and glass-ceramic materials. Color tunable white light emission has been obtained using UV excitation. Influence of the SrF2 crystallization on luminescence properties of prepared materials have been described in detail. Moreover, luminescence properties and especially emission color dependence on the Eu3+ to Dy3+ molar ratio have been exhaustively studied. Color-tunable white light emission has been observed as a result of simultaneous radiative transition of both, Eu3+ and Dy3+ ions when applying UV excitation. Judd â Ofelt and other optical parameters have been calculated based on luminescence emission spectra. Achieved results confirm that tellurite glass-ceramics containing SrF2 nanocrystals are good hosts for RE3+ ions and they can be considered as new phosphors for white light emitting diodes WLEDs.",1
"Multicomponent glass and laser-evaporated thin films prepared from the glass were studied by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The composition of the glass and the film as determined through RBS suggested that the films were deficient in oxygen. Furthermore, an increase in the reduced states of vanadium ions in going from the glass to the film was detected from the shift in the binding energy of the core level peak of V 2p and the development of a component peak in the V L3M23V Auger spectra. The reduction of vanadium could have possibly occurred because of the loss of oxygen during evaporation and thus would support the RBS results.",0
"We examined basic luminescence properties and radiation response of sodium borate glass scintillators activated with Pb2+, Cu+, Ti4+, V5+, W6+ and Yb3+ ions, respectively. These glasses had more than 80% transparency for emission wavelength range, and strong absorption bands due to the charge transition of the ions were observed. In the photoluminescence spectra, all glasses demonstrated intense emission peak in visible region, which are corresponding to the ions with s2 (Pb2+), d10 (Cu+) and d0 (Ti4+, V5+, W6+) configuration. Additionally charge transfer emission was observed in Yb3+-doped glass. When 241Am 5.5Â MeV alpha-ray excited the glasses, they showed weak emission intensity because of low energy transfer efficiency from host lattice to emission center. By 241Am irradiated pulse height spectra, Cu+-doped glass demonstrated the highest scintillation output in the glasses.",1
